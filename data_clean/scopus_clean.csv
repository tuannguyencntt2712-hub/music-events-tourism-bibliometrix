Recently, culture tourism has been mooted as one of the avenues that could be used to diversify the tourism product away from nature-based tourism. Literature addressing the ways in which traditional music as a tourism product may be affected by commodification is limited. In this study, we explore the implications of cultural commodification on traditional iKalanga music using a case of Domboshaba traditional music festival. The key question being addressed is how commodification of iKalanga traditional music has affected its authenticity. Research materials used in this study were collected using the key informant interviews and a focus group discussion. Results showed that the commodification of traditional iKalanga music has considerably revolutionized the music. This paper notes that the changes observed in relation to iKalanga music have had a significant bearing on the authenticity of the music. Therefore, there is a need for communities to tread carefully in their endeavor to commodify traditional music so as to avoid a complete loss of the music’s authenticity. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",authenticity;botswana;cultural commodification;domboshaba;ikalanga music;traditional music festival,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Arcodia C., Whitford M., Festival attendance and development of social capital, Journal of Convention and Event Tourism, 8, 2, pp. 1-18, (2007); (2013); Chang J., Segmenting tourists to aboriginal cultural festivals: An example in the Rukai cultural area, Taiwan, Tourism Management, 27, pp. 1224-1234, (2006); Chhabra D., Healy R., Sills E., Staged authenticity and heritage tourism, Annals of Tourism Research, 30, 3, pp. 702-719, (2003); Cohen E., Authenticity and commoditization in tourism, Annals of Tourism Research, 15, pp. 371-386, (1988); Cohen E., ‘Primitive and remote’: Hill tribe trekking in Thailand, Annals of Tourism Research, 16, pp. 30-61, (1989); Cohen J.H., Browning A., The decline of a craft: Basket making in San Juan Guelavia, Oaxaca, Human Organization, 66, 3, pp. 299-239, (2007); Cole C., Beyond authenticity and commoditization, Annals of Tourism Research, 34, 4, pp. 943-960, (2007); Dahlberg A.C., Vegetation diversity and change in relation to land use, soil and rainfall: A case study of North-East District, Botswana, Journal of Arid Environments, 44, 1, pp. 19-40, (2000); De Bres K., Davis J., Celebrating group and place identity: A case study of a new regional festival, Tourism Geographies, 3, 3, pp. 326-337, (2001); Derret R., Regional festivals: nourishing community resilience: the nature and role of cultural festivals in Northern Rivers NSW communities, (2008); Getz D., Special events: Defining the product, Tourism Management, 10, 2, pp. 125-137, (1989); Getz D., Festivals and special events, Encyclopedia of hospitality and tourism, pp. 789-810, (1993); Getz D., Frisby W., Evaluating management effectiveness in community-run festivals, Journal of Travel Research, 27, pp. 22-27, (1988); 2011 population and housing census: Population of towns, villages and associated localities, (2012); Gursoy D., Kim K., Uysal M., Perceived impacts of festivals and special events by organisers: And extension and validation, Tourism Management, 25, pp. 171-181, (2004); Hinch T.D., Delamere T.A., Native festivals as tourism attractions: A community challenge, Journal of Applied Recreation Research, 18, 2, pp. 131-142, (1993); Jepson A., Wiltshier S., Clark A., Community festivals: involvement and inclusion.

This article addresses the relationship between music, culture and feminism and considers the extent to which world music creates spaces for transnational feminist praxis. Applying Chandra Mohanty’s ‘tourism’, ‘exploration’ and ‘solidarity’ models for internationalising feminism, I question whose feminism is performed and negotiated at WOMAD, one of the most influential international music festivals in Europe. I argue that world music encounters have the potential to both help and hinder the cause of feminism across borders as music can reinforce and resist power inequalities between women from different places and cultures and intercultural music encounters can create the conditions for locating transnational feminist discourse within specific struggles and working through the mutualities and tensions between different feminisms. In doing so, I seek to show the value of bridging feminist geography and musicology, as the former can be used to critically analyse the plurality of feminisms at play in musical contexts, while the latter can illustrate how transnational feminist work is being undertaken outside the explicitly political realm and how expressive means of communication may disrupt assumptions about empowering/disempowering feminisms and exemplify the complex intersections between feminism, place and culture. © 2022 The Author(s).

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative approach was used to find out themes from semi-structured face-to-face interviews with twenty visitors who attended various festivals in North Cyprus. Findings: The results of this research uncover that festivals considerably contribute to the local economy by attracting tourists, which boosts sales for local businesses and promotes traditional Cypriot cuisine. Additionally, festivals play a crucial role in preserving and promoting cultural heritage through traditional music, dance, and crafts, fostering community engagement and cultural exchange. The study also identifies key challenges and opportunities, such as the need for improved marketing strategies, enhanced infrastructure, and sustainable practices to mitigate environmental impacts.

This study aims to identify the destination food image of Gaziantep in Turkey, which is a member gastronomy city of the CCN since 2015. Identified destination food image elements were connected to the common targets of the CCN to show how the city may contribute to the network objectives. Design/methodology/approach: A two-stage research process was used in the study. First, qualitative approach was adopted for the clarification of projected and perceived destination food image elements. Projected image elements were derived from a content analysis performed on a totally 113 official, semi-official and unofficial online documents in Turkish and English. Perceived destination food image elements were identified by face-to-face interviews, conducted on 10 participants. As a result, 18 projected and 20 perceived destination food image elements were obtained. These were then grouped under 4 main and 22 sub-categories. At the second stage, destination food image elements were matched with common targets of the CCN. Findings: Destination food image elements, obtained by two qualitative studies, are grouped under 4 main and 22 sub-categories as follows: gastronomic identity (with sub-categories of destination’s identity and local culinary culture); diversity of the destination (with sub-categories of attractiveness of the local food, ease of promotion and high brand value); gastronomic attractions (with sub-categories of restaurants and cafes, culinary museums, farmer markets, orchards, gastronomy tours, gastronomy events (e.g. festivals, competitions), culinary education, books on gastronomy, certification systems, organizations, street foods and vendors and handmade or homemade foods); and qualified workforce and stakeholders (with sub-categories of expert chefs and cooks, specialist suppliers, service personnel, locals and local authorities). These are then connected to the common CCN targets (e.g. cuisine, tourism and festivals; extension of the creative value chain; fostering cultural creativity; and sustainability). Originality/value: This is one of the early research attempts in examining a member gastronomy city’s food image elements and the role that they played in the success of the CCN’s common targets. Moreover, the study contributes to the literature on the identification of (projected and perceived) destination food image by using content analysis. © 2020, International Tourism Studies Association.",destination food image;gastronomy city;gaziantep;the creative cities network;unesco,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ab Karim S., Chi C.G.Q., Culinary tourism as a destination attraction: an empirical examination of destinations’ food image, Journal of Hospitality Marketing & Management, 19, 6, pp. 531-555, (2010); Akin N., Bostanci B., Gaziantep as part of the UNESCO creative cities network: An assessment in the context of existing reports, Suleyman Demirel University Visionary Journal, 8, 19, pp. 110-124, (2017); Andreu L., Bigne J.E., Cooper C., Projected and perceived image of Spain as a tourist destination for British travellers, Journal of Travel & Tourism Marketing, 9, 4, pp. 47-67, (2000); Assael H., Consumer Behavior and Marketing Action, (1984); Baloglu S., McCleary K.W., A model of destination image formation, Annals of Tourism Research, 26, 4, pp. 868-897, (1999); Barbosa C., Lyon – UNESCO’s creative city of gastronomy?, Transnational Marketing Journal, 4, 2, pp. 126-132, (2016); Best J.W., Research in Education, (1970); Birdir K., Karakan H., Colak O., Swot analysis of Gaziantep province in terms of tourism and suggestions for the development of tourism, Journal of Travel and Hospitality Management, 13, 1, pp. 77-92, (2015); Bjork P., Kauppinen-Raisanen H., Local food: a source for destination attraction, International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 28, 1, pp. 177-194, (2016); Bloor M., On the analysis of observational data: a discussion of the worth and uses of induction techniques and respondent validation, Sociology, 12, 3, pp. 545-552, (1978); Brokaj M., The impact of the gastronomic offer in choosing tourism destination: The case of Albania, Academic Journal of Interdisciplinary Studies, 3, 2, pp. 249-258, (2014); Byon K.K., Zhang J.J., Development of a scale measuring destination image, Marketing Intelligence & Planning, 28, 4, pp. 508-532, (2010); Chang R.C.Y., Mak A.H.N., Understanding gastronomic image from tourists’perspective: a repertory grid approach, Tourism Management, 68, pp. 89-100, (2018); Chiovitti R.F., Piran N., Rigour and grounded theory research, Journal of Advanced Nursing, 44, 4, pp. 427-435, (2003); Choe J.Y.J., Kim S.S., Effects of tourists’ local food consumption value on attitude, food destination image, and behavioral intention, International Journal of Hospitality Management, 71, pp. 1-10, (2018); Choi S., Lehto X.Y., Morrison A.M., Destination image representation on the web: content analysis of Macau travel related websites, Tourism Management, 28, 1, pp. 118-129, (2007); Cohen J., A coefficient of agreement for nominal scales, Educational and Psychological Measurement, 20, 1, pp. 37-46, (1960); Crompton J.L., Motivations for pleasure vacation, Annals of Tourism Research, 6, 4, pp. 408-424, (1979); Doldur H., Gaziantep: One of the gastronomy city selected by UNESCO, Global Issues and Trends in Tourism, pp. 669-678, (2016); du Rand G.E., Heath E., Towards a framework for food tourism as an element of destination marketing, Current Issues in Tourism, 9, 3, pp. 206-234, (2006); Elo S., Kaariainen M., Kanste O., Polkki T., Utriainen K., Kyngas H., Qualitative content analysis: A focus on trustworthiness, Sage Open, 4, 1, pp. 1-10, (2014); Emmendoerfer M., Emmendoerfer L., Ashton M., Analysis of the heritage requalification process to the recognition of a UNESCO creative city of gastronomy, Tourism and Cultural Landscapes 2016 Conference in Budapest, Hungary, 2016 Foundation for Information Society (INFOTA, pp. 163-173, (2016); Folgado-Fernandez J.A., Hernandez-Mogollon J.M., Duarte P., Destination image and loyalty development: the impact of tourists’ food experiences at gastronomic events, Scandinavian Journal of Hospitality and Tourism, 17, 1, pp. 92-110, (2017); Fox R., Reinventing the gastronomic identity of Croatian tourist destinations, International Journal of Hospitality Management, 26, 3, pp. 546-559, (2007); Frochot I., An analysis of regional positioning and its associated food images in french tourism regional brochures, Journal of Travel & Tourism Marketing, 14, 3-4, pp. 77-96, (2003); Gartner W.C., Image formation process, Journal of Travel & Tourism Marketing, 2, 2-3, pp. 191-216, (1994); Graneheim U.H., Lundman B., Qualitative content analysis in nursing research: concepts, procedures and measures to achieve trustworthiness, Nurse Education Today, 24, 2, pp. 105-112, (2004); Guest G., Bunce A., Johnson L., How many interviews are enough?

Developing MMPs for events with uncertain spatial demand is a particular challenge. This paper investigates whether reliable demand data can be extracted from mining social network (Twitter) content and using the resulting information to inform the design of commercially viable bus routes from peri-urban areas of Barcelona to a large music event (Canet Rock). Using data from relevant Twitter users, a Twitter influence score was established for each of the 947 municipalities in the Barcelona Region, providing a spatially distributed picture of the demand to attend the event, prior to event ticket purchase. This was used as the basis for planning and delivering 11 new commercially viable event bus routes transporting over 450 additional passengers from peri-urban and more rural areas in the Barcelona Region. This paper demonstrates that the innovation of information mining from Social Networks can provide better comprehension of the demand to support Mobility Management Planning for large events and can radically improve the ability of bus services to serve demand from peri-urban and rural areas. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",demand responsive bus;mobility demand prediction;mobility management planning;social media;user-generated data;spain;rural areas;urban planning;urban transportation;barcelona,Barcelona [Catalonia]; Catalonia; Spain; Data mining; Rural areas; Social networking (online); Transportation routes; Uncertainty analysis; Urban planning; Urban transportation; Barcelona; Bus route; Demand responsive bus; European cities; Mobility demand prediction; Mobility management; Mobility management planning; Network data; Social media; User-generated data; bus transport; mobility; prediction; social media; social network; transportation planning; travel demand; Buses,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Abbasi A., Rashidi T.H., Maghrebi M., (2015); Boyd D., Crawford K., Critical questions for big data: Provocations for a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon, Inf., Commun.

Design/methodology/approach: The methodology used in this exploratory study consists of establishing a recommended framework to assess social media accessibility for PwD, especially for people with visual and hearing disabilities (PwVHD), and analyse, through an observation grid, if the information published on the official pages of the “Rock in Rio Lisboa” music festival on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube is accessible for this target audience. Findings: The results indicate that, although the Rock in Rio Lisboa music festival is promoted as a festival for all, posts on social media are not accessible for people with visual and/or hearing disabilities and do not meet most of the defined parameters established in the proposed assessment framework. Originality/value: Social media accessibility has not been analysed in previous research in the tourism context. This paper aims to fill in the void by establishing criteria and parameters that can serve as a basis for a framework for accessibility assessment in social media for PwVHD. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",accessibility;accessible tourism;information;music festival;people with disabilities;rock in rio lisboa;social media,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Almeida-Santana A., Moreno-Gil S., New trends in information search and their influence on destination loyalty: digital destinations and relationship marketing, Journal of Destination Marketing & Management, 6, pp. 150-161, (2017); Altinay Z., Saner T., Bahcelerli N.M., Altinay F., The role of social media tools: accessible tourism for disabled citizens, Educational Technology and Society, 19, 1, pp. 89-99, (2016); Ambrose I., Garcia A., Papamichail K., Veitch C., Manual de gestão de destinos turísticos acessíveis, (2017); Anuar F.I., Yahya N., Yulia, Understanding the relationship of travel motivation factors and decision-making among visual impaired tourists: exploring the moderating effect of social media, Advanced Science Letters, 23, 1, pp. 462-466, (2017); Agarwal Y., Accessibility information in New Delhi for ‘Easer Access’ Android-based app for persons with disability: an observational study, Disability and Rehabilitation: Assistive Technology, 14, 7, pp. 645-662, (2019); 249 Festivais de música em Portugal no ano de 2016, (2017); Annual report: festivais de música 2018, (2019); Baker P.M.A., Bricout J.C., Moon N.W., Coughlan B., Pater J., Communities of participation: a comparison of disability and aging identified groups on Facebook and LinkedIn, Telematics and Informatics, 30, 1, pp. 22-34, (2013); Bergier B., Bergier J., Kubinska Z., Environmental determinants of participation in tourism and recreation of people with varying degrees of disability, Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part A, 73, 17-18, pp. 1134-1140, (2010); Blichfeldt B., Nicolaisen J., Disabled travel: not easy, but doable, Current Issues in Tourism, 14, 1, pp. 79-102, (2011); Blitz, Os números dos festivais em Portugal em 2017, (2017); Card J.A., Cole S.T., Humphrey A.H., A comparison of the Accessibility and Attitudinal Barriers Model: travel providers and travellers with physical disabilities, Asia Pacific Journal of Tourism Research, 11, 2, pp. 161-175, (2006); Social media and accessibility overview, (2017); Carneiro M.J., Eusebio C., Pelicano M., An expenditure patterns segmentation of the music festivals' market, International Journal of Sustainable Development, 14, 3-4, pp. 290-308, (2011); Crawford D.W., Godbey G., Reconceptualizing barriers to family leisure, Leisure Sciences, 9, (1987); Caton S., Chapman M., The use of social media and people with intellectual disability: a systematic review and thematic analysis, Journal of Intellectual and Developmental Disability, 41, 2, pp. 125-139, (2016); Choudhury M., Dinger Z., Fichera E., The utilization of social media in the hearing aid community, American Journal of Audiology, 26, pp. 1-9, (2017); Loudly crying face’: your cute emojis are spoiling social media for blind users, (2018); Daniels M.J., Rodgers E.R., Wiggins B.P., ‘Travel Tales’: an interpretive analysis of constraints and negotiations to pleasure travel as experienced by persons with physical disabilities, Tourism Management, 26, pp. 919-993, (2005); Darcy S., Inherent complexity: disability, accessible tourism and accommodation information preferences, Tourism Management, 30, pp. 816-826, (2010); Davis A., Experiential places or places of experience?

Design/methodology/approach: A mixed method approach was utilized to achieve data triangulation through a content analysis of websites, content analysis of social media sites as well as interviews. Findings: Findings indicated that 64% of festivals did not communicate any sustainable practices through their websites and only 6% communicated via social media. The most common sustainability practices communicated were waste management and sustainable transportation, yet few festivals engaged in effective, consistent and sufficient marketing of initiatives to festivalgoers. Best practice festivals (having communicated 5.47 initiatives or more) were found to have been significantly more likely than non-best practice festivals to be music festivals and have been in operation longer. Best practice festivals were also more likely than non-best practice festivals to have sustainability engrained into their corporate philosophy via a communicated sustainable vision and mission. Interviews revealed that most festivals did not have a designated role responsible for all sustainable initiatives and the responsibility was often taken on by volunteers or festival organizers. Festival organizers that communicated sustainability initiatives efficiently, consistently, and sufficiently perceived these efforts to benefit the festivals value amongst festivalgoers and host communities. Propensity to communicate sustainability initiatives was found to have been impacted by awareness, categorization, timing, policy and funding. Research limitations/implications: While the findings are limited to the country of Canada and the extent of communication on websites and social media platforms as well as those festivals who participated, interviews helped to overcome these limitations as they gained an understanding of what was undertaken but not necessarily communicated. Practical implications: The findings generated from this study could be used as a guide for establishing a benchmark for festivals regarding sustainable communication as well as strategies for overall corporate responsibility. Content regarding sustainability at festivals is scarce, as is information on festival communication. As a result, this paper seeks to understand the sustainable initiatives that are being communicated by festivals. Originality/value: This is the first time Cultivation Theory was used within a tourism context and may be a useful tool to determine value creation. Through Cultivation Theory, festival organizers believed to have the ability to impact perceived value of the festival by implementing efficient, consistent and sufficient communication of sustainability initiatives. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",communication;cultivation theory;festival;social media;sustainability,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Alves H.M.B., Cerro A.M.C., Martins A.V.F., Impact of small tourism events on rural places, Journal of Place Management and Development, 3, 1, pp. 22-37, (2010);

The elements of festival experiences were analysed through social media opinions of Sziget Festival attendees published between 1 January 2014 and 31 July 2022, using structural topic model (STM) computer algorithm and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). Our findings support existing literature, showing that festival experiences are cognitive-affective in nature with key elements of socialisation, environment, and festival value, some of which are inter-connected. Although this kind of research is rare in tourism, our paper argues for its usefulness and provides an example of application, using consumer data to facilitate decision-making and support the festival industry. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research, as well as incorporating LDA with other qualitative and quantitative research. © 2024 The Author(s).",customer experience;festival experience;latent dirichlet allocation;social media analysis;topic modelling,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Adam I., Negative tourist-to-tourist interactions, value destruction, satisfaction, and post consumption behavioral intention, Journal of Destination Marketing & Management, 20, (2021); Aguado L.

This study introduces the Kano model into the field of satisfaction research, makes improvements according to its advantages and disadvantages, builds an evaluation index system for night tourism satisfaction in tourism and leisure blocks, and combines that system with a questionnaire to determine the priority for optimizing each factor using the main and vice qualities, dispersion degree, and sensitivity comparison analysis. Based on the results, several optimization suggestions are proposed. The results show that: (1) Night tourism in Qinghefang groups mainly involves young people; (2) The overall satisfaction level is relatively high; (3) One attractive factor, seven one-dimensional factors, ten indifference factors, and three reverse factors in four layers (facility, service, experience, and project) were identified; (4) The priority for improvement should be service layer > facility layer > experience layer > project layer; (5) Background music, cultural connotation, festival projects, etc. are favored by visitors; and (6) Transportation, service attitude, and the sense of participation urgently require optimization. © 2024, Editorial office of Journal of Resources and Ecology.

Sustainable development is now a part of tourism strategies and visions, especially when it comes to the possible links between tourism and its impact on sustainable development. In addition, the ubiquitous digitalization has also made a significant impact on both. In this paper, we analyze the role of the sustainable tourism in the digital age using the example of the Burning Man festival, an annual event held in Nevada desert each year around Labour Day weekend with nearly sixty thousand people gathering to build a temporary city full of art, music, and interactivity. Our study is based on a unique own survey questionnaire administered at Burning Man festival in 2017. We use the travel cost method for computing the non-market valuation of demand from visiting Burning Man and show how digitalization helped the event to survive amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, this paper outlines the impact that the relationship between tourism, digitalization, and sustainable development can have on the economic growth and the institutional change. We argue that sustainable tourism can meet the needs of the current tourism industry (both domestic and international), while protecting the environment, promoting future opportunities, as well as taking into account the long-term impact of tourism on local communities and the local and international economy © 2021,Terra Economicus.All Rights Reserved",consumer surplus;digitalization;institutional change;sustainable tourism;travel cost method,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Agh P., Vavrek R., Dvorak M., Papcunova V., Economic evaluation of the management of municipal firms at the level of rural local self-governments (Case study), Economies, 9, 3, (2021); Bak I., Szczecinska B., Global demographic trends and effects on tourism, European Research Studies, 23, 4, pp. 571-585, (2020); Cabelkova I., Strielkowski W., Rybakova A., Molchanova A., Does playing video games increase emotional creativity?, International journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 17, 7, (2020); Canoy N., Roxas G., Robles A., Alingasa A, Ceperiano A., From cesspool to fortified paradise: analyzing news media territorial assemblages of rehabilitating Boracay Island, Western Philippines, Journal of Sustainable Tourism, 28, 8, pp. 1138-1157, (2020); Chen K., Enabling Creative Chaos: The Organization Behind the Burning Man Event, (2009); Chiaba A., Platt S., Strielkowski W., Eliciting users' preferences for cultural heritage and tourism-related e-services: a tale of three European cities, Tourism Economics, 20, 2, pp. 263-277, (2014); Cristiano S., Gonella Г., Kill Venice': A systems thinking conceptualisation of urban life, economy, and resilience in tourist cities, Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, 7, 1, pp. 1-13, (2020); De Luca G., Shirvani Dastgerdi A., Francini C., Liberatore G., Sustainable cultural heritage planning and management of overtourism in art cities: Lessons from atlas world heritage, Sustainability, 12, 9, (2020); Doherty B., This Is Burning Man, (2006); Dvorak M., Rovny P., Grebennikova V., Faminskaya M., EconoImcimaartiolC0VID-l1ontheSabor market and human capital, Terra Economicus, 18, 4, pp. 78-96, (2020); Farinha Г., Bienvenido-Huertas D., Duarte Pinheiro M., Silva E., Lanca R., Jose Oliveira M., Batista R., Sustainable competitiveness of tourism in the Algarve Region.

Festivals have the potential to attract tourists, stimulate local economies, and contribute to the overall development and sustainability of a destination’s tourism industry. The aim of the study above is to investigate how the product of pop festival tourism is changing in Poland. This applies to the scale of the event, the nature of the performers, the place of organization, the tourist profile, the level of loyalty (returns) etc. The four largest pop music festivals in Poland were selected for the analysis: Pol’and’Rock Festival, Open’er Festival, Orange Warsaw Festival and Sunrise Festival. The results show i.e. that: i. the scale of music festival is increasing substantially – both regarding the number of viewers and duration of the event; ii- Festivals develop from “just music” into a full tourist product, iii- The festival tourist enjoy different type of non-music activities provided by the festival organizers more voluntary than then others, iv - The activities provided by the organizers are evaluating “together with the public”. © 2024 Publishing India Group.

In a global competition, cities must stand out and attract tourism, investment, and cultural activities. Consequently, their image should be constantly improved. City branding provides strategies for enhancing a city's public image - thus, becoming more and more attractive. Events and festivals, like popular music festivals, offer valuable opportunities for promoting cities and boosting tourism. The aim of this research is to explore the potential of music festivals in building city image and integrating it into the broader branding processes. The results are based on semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire survey. The findings support the hypothesis that festivals can significantly raise destination awareness, and shape image, and through them, a wider audience can be reached.

Through the ages, people in China have expressed their religious feelings and experiences in the objects they display, worship, and exchange, as well as in the spaces that they build and inhabit. In this process, religious beliefs are externalized in forms of material culture, including symbols, texts, relics, music, and temples. As a result, these artifacts and places carry individual and collective memories and affects that allow believers to experience religion not only at special events like festivals and pilgrimages, but in everyday life. In modern China, the connotations and forms of material carriers have diversified. The rise of souvenirs and other forms of cultural consumption have transformed the materialization of religiosity. In the worship of Mazu, the relationship between pilgrimage, tourism, entertainment, and the production and circulation of commodities has become increasingly tight, changing the cult’s beliefs and their physical expression. That connection also brings social and economic sustenance to the local community. Taking the Mazu Temple in Meizhou as a case, this paper adopts a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approach to examine the pilgrimage–tourism–commerce nexus, as well as other contemporary forms of the materialization of her cult. © 2023 by the authors.",ancestral temple of mazu;commodification;material culture;religious tourism;the worship of mazu,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Bremer T.S., Consider the Tourist, Wiley Blackwell Companion to Religion and Materiality, pp. 187-206, (2020); Bynum C.W., Christian Materiality: An Essay on Religion in Late Medieval Europe, (2011); Chang H., Mazu zaoxiang yu biaozhun hua wenti taolun (The Discussion of Mazu’s Iconography and the Question of Standardization), Zongjiao Renlei Xue (Religious Anthropology), 4, pp. 149-167, (2013); Chau A.Y., Miraculous Response: Doing Popular Religion in Contemporary China, (2006); Chidester D., Authentic Fakes: Religion and American Popular Culture, (2005); Dittmar H., The Social Psychology of Material Possessions: To Have Is to Be, (1992); Feuchtwang S., Popular Religion in China: The Imperial Metaphor, (2001); Fleming B., Mann R., Material Culture and Asian Religions: Text, Culture, and Image, (2018); Goossaert V., Palmer D.A., The Religious Question in Modern China, (2011); Habkirk S., Chang H., Scents, Community, and Incense in Traditional Chinese Religion, Material Religion, 13, pp. 156-174, (2017); Jiang W., Zheng L., The Compilation of Mazu’s Historical Material and Texts (the First Volume): The Volume of Inscriptions (Mazu Wenxian Shiliao huIbian Diyi Ji: BEIJI Juan), (2007); Jiang W., Zhou J., The Compilation of Mazu’s Historical Material and Texts (the Second Volume: The Volume of Writings (Mazu Wenxian Shiliao Huibian Dier Ji: Zhulu Juan), (2009); Jiang W., Zhu H., The Record of Mazu at Meizhou Fujian: Local Gazetteers Publications (Meizhou Mazu Zhi), (2011); Johnson D.G., Spectacle and Sacrifice: The Ritual Foundations of Village Life in North China, (2009); Lagerwey J., China, a Religious State, (2010); Li X., The Study of Mazu Belief (Mazu Xinyang Yanjiu), (1995); Lin W.-P., Why Build a Temple?

Among the competitive Romanian tourism products, festival tourism should be mentioned, even though it is relatively new. Therefore, given the traditional communities from rural areas which are confronted with an international flux of tourists, it is vital to analyze the perception of and support for festivals. The presumption is that if there are benefits for the locals, support increases. In order to achieve the objective of the study, research has been conducted among the local rural community of Bontida, which is the location of an international annual music festival. The instrument used was a questionnaire which had four parts that aimed to measure the cultural benefits and costs of the festival and the sense of well-being of the community, given the fact that previous studies focused mainly on the economic and environmental impacts, but not so much on the socio-cultural dimensions. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. The results indicated that the benefits are greater than the perceived costs, a fact which is encouraging from the perspective of developing a sustainable tourism strategy, both by the local authorities and private stakeholders. © 2021 by the authors.",community well-being;festival tourism;music festival;residents’ support;rural community;socio-cultural benefits,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Perdue R.R., Long P.T., Allen L., Rural Resident Tourism Perceptions and Attitudes, Ann.

Meanwhile, musicological scholarship rarely centers the experiences and exploits of politicians who participated in early modern musical events. This case study on British envoys to Venice in the early Stuart period illustrates how musical activity and political work were, in fact, thoroughly imbricated within the daily mechanics of cross-confessional ambassadorship. Drawing on seventeenth-century diplomatic sources, I detail how both English and Northern Italian politicians made strategic use of sacred music-making—particularly vocal performance in local nunneries—to influence their dealings with foreign states, as well as how English diplomats in the Italian peninsula surveilled Catholic musical devotions in their covert correspondences to communicate information about international affairs. In revealing these moments of interconnection between music, religion, and geopolitics, I seek to further recent efforts in the New Diplomatic History to highlight the contributions of women and artistic practice within histories of international relations. © 2022 by the author.

In particular, there is an interplay between four dimensions of experience (i.e. affective, cognitive, physical, and novel) and satisfaction. The current study builds upon a primary dataset consisting of 1599 responses obtained from visitors attending two leisure activities, namely, a sport event and a music festival in Norway. The results show that the four experience dimensions’ direct effects on satisfaction differ between the two types of activities. The impact of affective engagement on satisfaction is significantly higher at the music festival than at the sport event, and the impact of cognitive engagement on satisfaction is significant at the sport event but not at the music festival. This paper highlights the importance of carefully managing events and festival engagement profiles to improve visitor satisfaction. Furthermore, it contributes to the literature by showing that the values assigned by respondents to cognitive, physical, and novel engagement differ significantly between sport events and music festivals and are contextually dependent. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",events;experience;experience economy;satisfaction;norway;festival;music;tourism;tourist behavior,Norway; festival; music; sport; tourism; tourist behavior,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Alegre J., Juaneda C., Destination loyalty: Consumers’ economic behavior, Annals of Tourism Research, 33, 3, pp. 684-706, (2006); Ali F., Ryu K., Hussain K., Influence of experiences on memories, satisfaction and behavioral intentions: A study of creative tourism, Journal of Travel & Tourism Marketing, 33, 1, pp. 85-100, (2016); Aliman N.K., Hashim S.M., Wahid S.D., Harudin S., Tourists’ satisfaction with a destination: An investigation on visitors to langkawi island, British Journal of Marketing Studies, 4, 2, pp. 1-20, (2016); Andersson T., Armbrecht J., Factors explaining the use-value of sport event experiences, International Journal of Event and Festival Management, 5, 3, pp. 235-246, (2014); Armbrecht J., Andersson D.T., The event experience, hedonic and eudaimonic satisfaction and subjective well-being among sport event participants, Journal of Policy Research in Tourism, Leisure and Events, 12, 3, pp. 457-477, (2020); Armbrecht J., Lundberg E., Andersson T., Mykletun R., 20 years of Nordic event and festival research: A review and future research agenda, Scandinavian Journal of Hospitality and Tourism, 21, 1, pp. 49-59, (2021); Ayob N., Wahid N.A., Omar A., Mediating effect of visitors' event experiences in relation to event features and post-consumption behaviors, Journal of Convention & Event Tourism, 14, 3, pp. 177-192, (2013); Berridge G., Designing event experiences, The Routledge handbook of events, (2012); Bigne J.E., Sanchez M.I., Sanchez J., Tourism image, evaluation variables and after purchase behaviour: Inter-relationship, Tourism Management, 22, 6, pp. 607-616, (2001); Bitner M.J., Servicescapes: The impact of physical surroundings on customers and employees, Journal of Marketing, 56, 2, pp. 57-71, (1992); Brodie R.J., Linda D., Hollebeek B.J., Ilic A., Customer Engagement: conceptual domain, fundamental propositions, and implications for research, Journal of Service Research, 14, 3, pp. 252-271, (2011); Chang L., A psychometric evaluation of 4- point and 6-point Likert-type scale in relation to reliability and validity, Applied Psychological Measurement, 18, 3, pp. 205-215, (1994); Chang P.L., Chieng M.H., Building consumer–brand relationship: A cross-cultural experiential view, Psychology and Marketing, 23, 11, pp. 927-959, (2006); Cochran W.G., Sampling techniques, (1977); Colombo A., Marques L., Motivation and experience in symbiotic events: An illustrative example grounded in culture and business events, Journal of Policy Research in Tourism, Leisure and Events, 12, 2, pp. 222-238, (2020); Crompton J.L., McKay S.L., Motives of visitors attending festival events, Annals of Tourism Research, 24, 2, pp. 425-439, (1997); Dawes J., Do data characteristics change according to the number of scale points used?

The purpose of this paper is to enhance the understanding of sustainable events by analysing value co-creation processes from the attendees’ perspective. Design/methodology/approach: The methodical framework comprises two steps. First, the study analyses the literature related to festivals and value co-creation, with a focus on sustainable festivals. Second, data rooted research based on grounded theory is conducted, using 12 semi-structured interviews with music festival attendees. Findings: Three distinct festival attendee categories were identified: the sustainable co-creation type, the calculating type and the experience type. Within each category, attendees have different attitudes, personal values and experiences as well as individual assessments of what exactly constitutes value and value creation. These three categories are regarded as key factors in describing different kinds of value co-creation processes in the festival context. Research limitations/implications: Considering these three types and addressing their personal values, beliefs and value perceptions will allow festival organisers to better manage the development of sustainable festivals and their role as value co-creators. Originality/value: This paper addresses the need to better understand how value is created in a festival context. The application of grounded theory also considers scholarly calls for a deeper search into the meaning and essence of value for festival attendees. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",co-creation;grounded theory;music festival;sustainable festivals;value,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Aquilani B., Silvestri C., Ioppolo G., Ruggieri A., The challenging transition to bio-economies: towards a new framework integrating corporate sustainability and value co-creation, Journal of Cleaner Production, 172, pp. 4001-4009, (2018); Arcodia C., Cohen S.A., Dickson C., Accrediting sustainable event practice, Knowledge Management in Tourism: Policy and Governance Applications, 4, pp. 209-218, (2012); Arnould E.J., Rudiments of a value praxeology, Marketing Theory, 14, 1, pp. 129-133, (2013); Bowen H.E., Daniels M.J., Does the music matter?

For that reason, this research examines the antecedents and consequents of the consumer-based brand equity (CBBE) of an event. Design/methodology/approach: After data collection, which was carried out through a questionnaire, the structural equation model was used to analyze the statistical data. The results were based on a sample of 329 participants who attended two major music festivals in Portugal: NOS Primavera Sound and NOS Alive Portugal. Findings: For both samples, this research shows that many aspects related to the event (image, experience and satisfaction) impact CBBE and CBBE influences destination image, the intention to revisit the destination and the intention to recommend the destination. Originality/value: This study presents itself as innovative since it brings the CBBE of an event to the center of an investigation, showing how it helps transfer the effects of image, satisfaction and the experience of a festival to a destination image, the intention to revisit and the intention to recommend a place. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",consumer-based brand equity;destination image;events;intention to recommend;revisit intention,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Aaker D., Managing Brand Equity: Capitalizing on the Value of a Brand Name, (1991);

Based on the cognitive appraisal theory, this study explores five antecedents of music festival visitors' flow experience (skill performance, ambiance, self-congruence, other consumers' passion, consumer-to-consumer interaction) and two consequences (visitors' memory and behavioral intentions) to enrich relevant research. In this study, a total of 419 visitors were investigated. All of the participants were visitors of 2019 Midi music festival, the largest music festival in China. Findings indicate that five antecedents are all positively related to visitors' flow experience, which in turn positively affects visitors' memory and behavioral intentions. Visitors' memory also has a positive effect on their behavioral intentions. In addition, the mediating role of flow experience between its antecedents and consequences was examined. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",cognitive appraisal theory;flow experience;music festival;music tourism,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Aaker J.L., The malleable self: The role of self-expression in persuasion, Journal of Marketing Research, 36, 1, pp. 45-57, (1999); Adam I., Backpackers' risk perceptions and risk reduction strategies in Ghana, Tourism Management, 49, pp. 99-108, (2015); Agarwal R., Karahanna E., Time flies when you're having fun, MIS Quarterly, 24, 4, pp. 665-694, (2000); Ajzen I., Fishbein M., Understanding attitudes and predicting social behavior, (1980); Ali F., Ryu K., Hussain K., Influence of experiences on memories, satisfaction and behavioral intentions: A study of creative tourism, Journal of Travel & Tourism Marketing, 33, 1, pp. 85-100, (2016); Anderson J.C., Gerbing D.W., Structural equation modelling in practice: A review and recommended two-step approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, 3, pp. 411-423, (1988); Anderson B., Morton F., Revill G., Practice of music and sound, Social & Cultural Geography, 6, 5, pp. 639-644, (2010); Andersson T.D., Getz D., Tourism as a mixed industry: Differences between private, public and not-for-profit festivals, Tourism Management, 30, 6, pp. 847-856, (2009); Arnold M.B., Emotion and personality, (1960); Baike B., Introduction to Midi music festival, (2020); Baker J., The role of the environment in marketing services: The consumer perspective, The service challenge: Integrating for competitive advantage, pp. 79-84, (1987); Ballantyne J., Ballantyne R., Packer J., Designing and managing music festival experiences to enhance attendees' psychological and social benefits, Musicae Scientiae, 18, 1, pp. 65-83, (2014); Bennett A., Woodward I., Festival spaces, identity, experience and belonging, The festivalization of culture, pp. 11-25, (2014); Bitner M.J., Servicescapes: The impact of physical surroundings on customers and employees, Journal of Marketing, 56, 2, pp. 57-71, (1992); del Bosque I.R., San Martin H., Tourist satisfaction: A cognitive-affective model, Annals of Tourism Research, 35, 2, pp. 551-573, (2008); Bowen H.E., Daniels M.J., Does the music matter?

In addition, we highlighted the importance of ICT usage on large-scale events for achieving smart tourism agenda. The importance and performance analysis of 38 attributes related to usage of ICTs at EXIT, a well-known European music festival held annually in Novi Sad (Serbia), was conducted. By employing an exploratory factor analysis, seven factors were extracted. The results show that the “level of smartness” of EXIT festival is relatively low. Furthermore, some advanced smart applications do not necessarily match tourists’ needs and interests, while festival organizers should focus on more basic online information access. Festival should make an optimal use of smart tourism facilities by offering the right smart tourism devices and services, enabling tourists to meet smart technologies on time. © 2019 Asia Pacific Tourism Association.",exit festival;festival organizers;festival visitors;ict;ipa matrix;large-scale events;novi sad;smart festival;smart technologies;tourists preferences;serbia;festival,Novi Sad;

All of these events take place in unique contexts, offering diverse experiences to participant groups. Music festivals and concerts have attracted the interest of researchers given the diversity of musical styles and target audiences. However, although being a globally popular musical style, choir events are underrepresented. This article describes participant segments of the World Choir Games held in South Africa; a first for the African continent. A postevent online survey was used to collect data from 384 performers. Psychographic variables were used to segment the groups (perceived event experiences, motivations, level of involvement and attachment, host city perceptions). Exploratory factor analysis identified two involvement, four motivational, and five event experience dimensions. Hierarchical cluster analysis distinguished between three groups labeled as Choristers, Exploring aficionados, and Followers. Across all segments, hedonia (enjoyment) remained the main motivator for participation. The first two segments had the same levels of involvement and attachment, as well as the desire to experience triumph and prestige associated with this world-class competition. However, participants who had a greater interest in enjoyment, destination exploration, mastery, and communitas, reported greater perceived experiences across all dimensions, and more positive host city perceptions. The third segment displayed significantly lower levels of motivation, experiences, and host city perceptions. The results highlight experience dimensions that warrant further investigation in the context of performers as opposed to audiences. This knowledge assists event organizers to adapt event marketing and program content for similar events. © 2022.

Given the magnitude these music festivals have reached, it is relevant to analyze the sustainability of such events. While most of the studies have focused on how this tourist movement affects environmental sustainability, in this article a deeper reflection is made, moving toward another dimension of sustainability: social sustainability. Three different surveys were carried out to analyze the social sustainability of a music event. A survey about the degree of acceptance from residents was used in the social sustainability analysis. A panel of experts measured the opinions about the social impact of the event. Finally, the assistants’ survey included questions such as type of tourist, expenditure profile, and satisfaction. The attendance of tourists at a festival must maintain harmony with the destination and its inhabitants; in this relationship both parties should benefit. The residents of the destination expect to obtain an improvement in their standard of living thanks to what the tourists bring them, which through their socially sustainable behavior describes a model that generates prosperity. The model that represents social sustainability is the one that will be developed after confirming the hypotheses put forward from the perspective of the prosperity of the residents and the contribution of the tourists themselves to social sustainability. © 2024 Common Ground Research Networks.

Furthermore, considering the evolving characteristics of the global population and changes in consumer behavior preferences, particularly the increasing use of coolness as a marketing tool targeting young people, this study develops a stimulus‒organism‒response (S–O-R) framework to examine the impact of perceived coolness on young tourists' pro-environmental behaviors and further investigates the gender differences in this relationship from the perspective of situated cognition. The approach used is deductive. According to data collected from 564 young visitors who attended the Strawberry Music Festival, males' perception of coolness directly influence their pro-environmental behavior, while females’ perception of coolness are indirectly influenced by place identity and psychological ownership. This study provides a valuable theoretical perspective on the influence of perceived situational factors on pro-environmental behavior among young tourists and offers insights for managers regarding promoting destination development and designing products. © 2023 The Authors",gender difference;perceived coolness;perceived situational factor;pro-environmental behavior;young tourists,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Allen B., Implementing trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) with preteen children displaying problematic sexual behavior, Cognitive and Behavioral Practice, 25, 2, pp. 240-249, (2018); Anholt S., Nation branding: A continuing theme, Journal of Brand Management, 10, 1, pp. 59-60, (2002); Anton C.E., Lawrence C., The relationship between place attachment, the theory of planned behaviour and residents' response to place change, Journal of Environmental Psychology, 47, pp. 145-154, (2016); Asatryan V.S., Oh H., Psychological ownership theory: An exploratory application in the restaurant industry, Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research, 32, 3, pp. 363-386, (2008); Ashfaq M., Jiang Y., Yu S., My smart speaker is cool!

Festivals have become key elements of event tourism, attracting huge numbers of tourists, and influencing regional economies, and with increasing globalization and accessibility of travel, festivals are becoming magnets for those seeking new cultural and entertainment experiences. The research aims to analyze and interpret the impact of festivals on the development of event tourism, considering current socio-cultural and economic trends. Among the methods used, analytical, statistical, functional, system analysis, deduction, synthesis, and comparison methods were applied. The study analyzed various aspects of the impact of festivals on event tourism such as economic benefits to regional communities, cultural exchange, media attention (media) and large-scale tourist influx. Different types of festivals (for example, music, culture, sports) and their impact on attracting different types of tourists were examined. The economic benefits that festivals bring to regional communities have been highlighted, which includes an assessment of employment, business growth, impact on trade, investment, and other aspects. The impact of festivals on the socio-cultural dynamics of regions is analyzed, and effective strategies for planning and promoting festivals to maximize their impact on event tourism are investigated. The practical significance lies in the application of the findings to address issues related to festivals to effectively develop event tourism. © 2024 The Author(s).",economic development;event marketing;management;media exposure;tourist flows,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Akhundova Ayatkin, Special Economic Zones as a Tool for Sustainable Tourism Development in the Republic of Azerbaijan, Review of Economics and Finance, 20, pp. 1101-1108, (2022);

The study reviews and bridges gaps in research on the specific genre of classical music festivals. It identifies that there have been no studies on the specific topic of rural classical music festivals and their social impacts. However, the study identifies and codes three key topics crucial to fostering social sustainability in the context of rural music festivals: community resilience, community resourcefulness, and inhabitants’ well-being. Furthermore, this research presents a self-reinforcing cycle among community resilience, resourcefulness, and well-being, and offers a model for future research. By employing a robust methodology, analyzing diverse sources, and offering fresh perspectives on social sustainability, this manuscript seeks to contribute to the fields of Geography, Tourism, Event Management, and the Sociology of Music. It also aims to promote a deeper sociological and geographical understanding of the role of classical music festivals in rural communities for policymakers, community leaders, and event managers who are seeking to promote socially sustainable development in their communities. © 2024 Common Ground Research Networks.

It examines how these two festivals were used to promote tourism, urban regeneration, rural development, image-making, and place branding. We argue that the interceltic festivals of Porto and Sendim are entangled with the Europeanisation of Portugal, involving new possibilities for identification with Europe's Atlantic fringe, a space that is symbolised by the Celtic imaginary.  © International Council for Traditional Music 2023.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Abreu P., Músicas em movimento.

Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a mixed methods research approach and employs two theoretical frameworks: theories of career development and fandom. Findings: In frequent festival attendance, both festival career development and festival fandom are most clearly present in motivation development and social dimensions. Practical implications: Strategically, frequent festivalgoers should be considered as crucial stakeholders, who might mobilize the co-creation of a sense of community or festival brand. Originality/value: Music-related fandom has been previously investigated in relation to artists and specific musical genres, but not so much in relation to music festivals in general. Career studies, on the other hand, concentrate heavily on sports events. There is a scarcity of research scrutinizing both career development and fandom in the festival context within the same study, and festival attendance as part of music tourism is an under-researched area. © 2021, Maarit Kinnunen, Antti Honkanen and Mervi Luonila.",audience;fandom;festival career;mixed methods research;music festival,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Amberla K., Festivals in Finland, Music Festivals, a Changing World, pp. 193-198, (2013); Bolderman L., Reijnders S., Have you found what you're looking for?

Focusing especially on the pre-festival experience but also addressing peri- and post-phases, this study examines the role of DMC in tourists’ experiences at British rock music festivals. Interviews with festivalgoers revealed three core and inter-related themes: information, emotional response and communitas. Initial engagement with DMC enabled planning, generated feelings of anticipatory excitement and created a sense of communitas. Online activity reduced peri-festival but continued to enhance the live event experience, while the virtual communitas was extended at the post-festival phase. © The Author(s) 2019.",co-creation;communitas;consumer behavior;digital media communication;festivalgoer;music festival;online experience;social media;tourist engagement;united kingdom,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Anderton C., ‘Music Festival Sponsorship: Between Commerce and Carnival’, Arts Marketing: An International Journal, 1, 2, (2011); Ballantyne J., Ballantyne R., Packer J., ‘Designing and Managing Music Festival Experiences to Enhance Attendees’ Psychological and Social Benefits’, Musicae Scientiae, 18, 1, pp. 65-83, (2014); Bowen H.E., Daniels M.J., ‘Does the Music Matter?

Fairy tourism or ‘fairy hunting’ has been acknowledged since the nineteenth century, but is largely overlooked in tourism literature, despite increasing exposure to fairy motifs through multi-media platforms, including films, gaming, and literature. This study examines fairy festivals using a theoretical framework based on the novel concept of ‘liminal affective technologies,’ (LATS), that are designed to enhance transformative potentiality. An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis method is used to analyse how fairy festival producers generate approximations of Fairyland. To create fairyscapes, their organisers devise LATs, such as situating the events in places that are bucolic, mystical and connected to local folklore, and staging workshops, music, and activities, such as wish-making, using fairy-themed motifs, to reinforce the magical narrative. Yet several festival producers ‘toned down’ the troublesome or Pagan elements of the fairyscape, explaining the surreality of their events to visitors as dreamscapes. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",fairy tourism;fantasy;liminality;literary tourism;magical geographies;magical tourism;storyscapes;transmedia tourism;tourism,conceptual framework; human geography; tourism,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Barthes R., Mythologies, (1957); Baudrillard J., Selected writings: Simulacra and simulation, (1981); Bettelheim B., The uses of enchantment, (1976); Buchmann A., Moore K., Fisher D., Experiencing film tourism: Authenticity & fellowship, Annals of Tourism Research, 37, 1, pp. 229-248, (2010); Chronis A., Tourists as story-builders: Narrative construction at a heritage museum, Journal of Travel & Tourism Marketing, 29, 5, pp. 444-459, (2012); Chronis A., Arnould E., Hampton R., Gettysburg re-imagined: The role of narrative imagination in consumption experience, Consumption Markets & Culture, 15, 3, pp. 261-286, (2012); The study of folklore, (1965); Echebiri M., (2023); The fairy faith in Celtic countries, (1994); Faulkes A., Edda, (1995); Gaffin D., Running with the fairies: Towards a transpersonal anthropology of religion, (2012); Greco M., Stenner P., From paradox to pattern shift: Conceptualising liminal hotspots and their affective dynamics, Theory & Psychology, 27, 2, pp. 147-166, (2017); Hanegraaff W.J., How magic survived the disenchantment of the world, Religion, 33, 4, pp. 357-380, (2003); Hemme D., Landscape, fairies and identity: Experience on the backstage of the fairy tale route, Journal of Tourism and Cultural Change, 3, 2, pp. 71-87, (2005); Hennig C., Tourism: Enacting modern myths, The tourist as a metaphor of the social world, pp. 169-187, (2002); Ironside R., Massie S., The folklore-centric gaze: A relational approach to landscape, folklore and tourism, Time and Mind, 13, 3, pp. 227-244, (2020); Keene M., Science in wonderland: The scientific fairy tales of Victorian Britain, (2015); Larkin M., Shaw R., Flowers P., Multiperspectival designs and processes in interpretative phenomenological analysis research, Qualitative Research in Psychology, 16, 2, pp. 182-198, (2019); Larkin M., Watts S., Clifton E., Giving voice and making sense in interpretative phenomenological analysis, Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, 2, pp. 102-120, (2006); Larrington C., The land of the green man: A journey through the supernatural landscapes of the British Isles, (2015); Lo Iacono V., Symonds P., Brown D.H., Skype as a tool for qualitative research interviews, Sociological Research Online, 21, 2, pp. 103-117, (2016); Lovell J., Fairytale authenticity: Historic city tourism, Harry Potter, medievalism and the magical gaze, Journal of Heritage Tourism, 14, 5-6, pp. 448-465, (2019); Lovell J., Opening spatial hinges with mindful writing practice: Negotiating Philip Pullman’s secret commonwealth, Cultural Geographies, 30, 2, pp. 279-298, (2023); Lovell J., Griffin H., Unfamiliar light: The production of enchantment, Annals of Tourism Research, 92, (2022); Lovell J., Thurgill J., Extending hot authentication: Imagining fantasy space, Annals of Tourism Research, 87, (2021); MacCannell D., Staged authenticity: Arrangements of social space in tourist settings, American Sociological Review, 79, 3, pp. 589-603, (1973); Meyer J.H.F., Land R., Threshold concepts and troublesome knowledge–Linkages to ways of thinking and practising, Improving student learning ten years on, pp. 412-424, (2003); Reijnders S., Places of the imagination: Media, tourism, culture, (2011); Siewers A.K., The green otherworlds of early medieval literature, The Cambridge companion to literature and the environment., pp. 31-44, (2014); Smith J.A., Flowers P., Larkin M., Interpretative phenomenological analysis: Theory, method and research, (2009); Stark R., Reconceptualizing religion, magic, and science, Review of Religious Research, 18, 25, pp. 101-120, (2001); Stenner P., Affect: On the turn, Affective transformations: Politics algorithms-media.

These music festival events not only invite composers to demonstrate their musical creations. But also they assist many independent bands realizing their musical dreams. This study analyzes how to influence the event image of music festival events for event participants. And it explores how factors that affect the tourist experience and enhance the event image related to this kind of activity. This study used four aspects to build a development strategies map utilizing the DEMATEL technique for the music festival events and establishes the group components of the PCA technique and then adopts the ANP technique to evaluate the aspects/components’ weights. Finally, the VIKOR technique was utilized to assess the competitive performance of the music festival events. The research reveals that the PP (package price) and SP (site planning) are primary influencers for music festival events. The event service providers can improve their promotional strategies by the NRM (network relation map) technique. This research provides recommendations for service providers to enhance their equipment plans and service experiences for music festival events. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",dematel;emerging culture festival;mcdm;music festival events;travel decision behavior;festival;music;tourist attraction,Taiwan; detection method; development strategy; festival; music; tourist attraction,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Afifi G.M.H., Jones E., Morgan N., Modelling Welsh cultural events, Tourism Management Perspectives, 19, pp. 80-89, (2016); Baloglu S., McCleary K.W., A model of destination image formation, Annals of Tourism Research, 26, 4, pp. 868-897, (1999); Beerli A., Martin J.D., Factors influencing destination image, Annals of Tourism Research, 31, 3, pp. 657-681, (2004); Blair A.R., Nachtmann R., Saaty T.L., Whitaker R., Forecasting the resurgence of the US economy in 2001: An expert judgment approach, Socio-Economic Planning Sciences, 36, 2, pp. 77-91, (2002); Chang C.W., Wu C.R., Lin C.T., Lin H.L., Evaluating digital video recorder systems using analytic hierarchy and analytic network processes, Information Sciences, 177, 16, pp. 3383-3396, (2007); Chen P.T., Medical big data applications: Intertwined effects and effective resource allocation strategies identified through IRA-NRM analysis, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 130, pp. 150-164, (2018); Chen F.H., Hsu T.S., Tzeng G.H., A balanced scorecard approach to establish a performance evaluation and relationship model for hot spring hotels based on a hybrid MCDM model combining DEMATEL and ANP, International Journal of Hospitality Management, 30, 4, pp. 908-932, (2011); Chi C.G.Q., Ouyang Z., Xu X., Changing perceptions and reasoning process: Comparison of residents’ pre- and post-event attitudes, Annals of Tourism Research, 70, pp. 39-53, (2018); Chirieleison C., Scrucca L., Event sustainability and transportation policy: A model-based cluster analysis for a cross-comparison of hallmark events, Tourism Management Perspectives, 24, pp. 72-85, (2017); Davis A., Experiential places or places of experience?

The present study analyzes online search behavior of potential attenders to a music festival. We hypothesize that the search process reveals latent patterns of behavior of cultural tourists planning to attend music festivals. To this end, information from Google Trends on queries related to three popular music festivals is used to build a network of search topics. Based on it, alternative exponential random graph model specifications are estimated. Findings support the general result of mediated information flows: music festivals induce planning and traveling queries. However, differences relating to the specificities of the cultural event are also found, in particular those regarding what nodes or queries supply the network with more useful information. © The Author(s) 2020.",cultural participation;exponential random graphs models;live music consumption;mediated consumer discovery;unstructured data;user-generated data;festival;heritage tourism;tourism economics;tourist attraction;tourist behavior;tourist destination,festival; heritage tourism; hypothesis testing; Internet; tourism economics; tourist attraction; tourist behavior; tourist destination; travel behavior,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Abbruzzo A., Brida J.G., Scuderi R., Determinants of individual tourist expenditure as a network: empirical findings from Uruguay, Tourism Management, 43, pp. 36-45, (2014); Ajzen I., The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); IX anuario de la música en vivo (IX Annual report of live music), (2018); Artola C., Pinto F., de Pedraza Garcia P., Can internet searches forecast tourism inflows?, International Journal of Manpower, 36, 1, pp. 103-116, (2015); Baez-Montenegro A., Devesa-Fernandez M., Motivation, satisfaction and loyalty in the case of a film festival: differences between local and non-local participants, Journal of Cultural Economics, 41, 2, pp. 173-195, (2017); Bangwayo-Skeete P.F., Skeete R.W., Can Google data improve the forecasting performance of tourist arrivals?

As an emerging industry, it has an immense contribution to make to the development of the local community if all stakeholders participate in a responsible manner. The social impact of tourism is, among other things, one that needs the attention of scholars. The social impact of tourism is immense and diverse, and it is embedded with other tourism impacts. So, studying is very essential to manage tourism in a responsible way. To address the stated objective, mixed research approaches were used. The result of the study indicated that tourism has both positive and negative impacts on tourist destinations. That one of the most important positive social effects of the development of tourism in Nubia is that tourism plays a role in social development, improving the standard of living, One of the most negative social impacts Imitating the locals the tourists in some negative aspects, Tourism development affects public Services Such as the problem of congestion and problems of sanitation and pressure on the various means of communication in Kerma, which drives citizens to feel upset and resentment, Some local residents have been negatively affected by tourists coming from different social backgrounds and behaviors, such as taking drugs and liqueurs as in Aswan. Finally, the researcher suggested take advantage of Nubian cultural and heritage elements of customs, traditions, handicrafts, dances, Nubian music, festivals and celebrations in attractions, reducing of entrance fees for tourist and archaeological sites. © 2024, Sohag University Publishing Center.

However, few studies have used these variables to segment attendee data over a multi-year period. Using the annual Double Decker Art, Music, and Food Festival in Oxford, Mississippi, this study compares and analyzes the differences between attendees clustered using satisfaction, perceived quality, demographic characteristics, and consumer expenditures. Three clusters were determined from the data, with one cluster exhibiting the highest levels of repeat visitation and willingness to spend more. This study demonstrates that attendees can be successfully segmented into homogenous groups, with implications for the festival along with future research endeavors emphasized. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",cluster analysis;festival;perceived quality;satisfaction,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Arcodia C., Whitford M., Festival attendance and the development of social capital, Journal of Convention & Event Tourism, 8, pp. 1-18, (2006);

It is a supplement to other recently published research by the author exploring the relation between the touristic offer of certain British jazz festivals and their lack of engagement with the significance of their own civic setting and heritage, focused on festivals held in Georgian or Regency locations (i.e., ones with strong links to the transatlantic slave trade). It explores and metaphorizes the double bass and its transatlantic resonances. It concludes with a small provocation in the form of a manifesto, aimed primarily at jazz festival directors. © 2021 Equinox Publishing Ltd, Office 415, The Workstation, 15 Paternoster Row, Sheffield S1 2BX.

In this study, a holistic assessment of the environmental impact of tourism has been carried out using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method, considering all stages of tourism activity: transportation from the place of origin to destination and back, accommodation, catering, and activities conducted. For this purpose, a case study has been carried out based on a typical trip made from Madrid to Rías Baixas (Galicia), considering a four-night stay and the performance of two activities (music festival and cultural museum) at the destination. Two alternative transportation scenarios (train or plane) have been defined to analyze the influence of the type of transportation on the overall impact. Other touristic activities such as visiting gardens or thermal baths instead of visiting a cultural museum or attending a music festival have been analyzed and it has been found that the thermal baths and the museum have the greatest environmental impacts. Transportation was the biggest contributor to most of the environmental impacts in the selected categories. On the other hand, the stay at the destination has stood out due to the impact of the consumption of food and energy used at the accommodation facility. The impact of the activities conducted at the destination is also worth highlighting. Finally, alternative scenarios for transportation have shown that the mode of transportation selected is key for lowering the overall environmental impact of the stay at the destination, highlighting the public transportation alternative, such as the train, as the most environmentally friendly option. © 2023 The Authors",carbon footprint;life cycle assessment (lca);sustainability;tourism;food;spain;sustainable development;environmental sustainability;tourism activities;tourism sectors;tourist destinations;tourist destination;music,Animals; Food; Gardening; Holidays; Life Cycle Stages; Tourism; Spain; Environmental impact; Life cycle; Social aspects; Sustainable development; Tourism; Case-studies; Environmental sustainability; Galicia; Life cycle assessment; Strategic sectors; Thermal bath; Tourism activities; Tourism sectors; Tourist destinations; Upward trend; carbon footprint; environmental impact assessment; life cycle analysis; public transport; tourism; tourist destination; article; carbon footprint; catering service; environmental impact; Galicia (Spain); human; information center; land use; life cycle assessment; music; night; spa treatment; tourism; animal; food; gardening; leisure; life cycle stage; Carbon footprint,NA,NA,NA,NA,"AIB.

Because such policies dried up important sources of income in the cultural and tourism industries, this paper examines how cultural institutions coped with this crisis. Drawing on the case of the Mannheim Philharmonic Orchestra in Germany, we collected original data and employed a regional economic impact analysis to determine both the financial resilience of the Orchestra and its impact on the urban economy. Because the Orchestra could not reduce costs during the COVID-19 pandemic, public subsidies were crucial to fill the income gap of missed live concerts. In turn, the regional impact analysis suggests that the Orchestra maintained its positive effect on the economic demand for goods and services in the urban economy. When balancing the city’s subsidies with the rental (city concert halls) and tax incomes generated by the Orchestra’s local impact, the Orchestra managed to induce surplus revenue for the city’s treasury. © 2023 by the authors.",creative industries;cultural industries;economic geography;germany;philharmonic orchestra;regional economic impact;urban economy;economic impact;urban area,Baden-Wurttemberg; Germany; Mannheim; creative industry; economic conditions; economic geography; economic impact; spatiotemporal analysis; urban area; urban economy,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Grabow B., Henckel D., Hollbach-Gromig B., Weiche Standortfaktoren, (1995); Florida R., The Rise of the Creative Class: And How It’s Transforming Work, Leisure, Community and Everyday Life, (2002); Florida R., Adler P., Mellander C., The City as Innovation Machine, Reg.

Additionally, music festivals or events are a continuous phenomenon in the context of the hospitality and tourism industry. In this study, a bibliometric approach was proposed to examine research that addresses both the H&T industry and music festivals. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 462 studies covering the years 1981–2024 were retrieved from the Scopus database. The study analyzed keywords, institutions, sources, countries, and titles. During the analysis phase, descriptive analysis, clustering, thematic mapping, and relationship networks were employed using Bibliometrix and VOSviewer analysis programs. Findings: As a result of the analysis, the most frequently used keywords were “tourism” and “festival,” with the most prolific author being Kruger M., the most productive country being the United States of America, and the leading journal being Event Management. Seven different clusters emerged from the networking of keywords. In the thematic map, the motor themes were music festivals, experience, social media, and co-creation. The basic themes were festival, music, tourism, event management, market segmentation, and music tourism. The emerging or declining themes were culture, music events, and COVID-19. Finally, the niche theme was entrepreneurship. Research limitations/implications: It’s noted that this research solely utilized the Scopus database and publications such as chemistry and mathematics, were excluded. The findings were limited to bibliometric analysis, and future studies could include content and thematic evaluations. Social implications: The research is useful in understanding how music festivals socially direct tourists and their future perspectives. On the other hand, determining the global status of scientific publications regarding music festivals with high social and economic impact is important for proper planning and sustainability of such events. Originality/value: Music festivals are an important type of event in terms of mobility in the H&T industry. In this respect, it is in a state of change and development over the years. This research examined publications about music festivals in the H&T industry from the past to the present with a bibliometric approach. In this way, the development of publications produced on the relevant subject was revealed. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",bibliometric;hospitality;music events;music festival;tourism,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Akgunduz Y., Cosar Y., Motivations of event tourism participants and behavioral Intentions, Tourism and Hospitality Management, 24, 2, pp. 341-358, (2018);

The aims of the study are to identify singing features in Chinese popular and traditional music, as well as to determine the ways in which musical genres influence vocals. Two teachers of modern vocal, two teachers of traditional vocal, 30 students of the Vocal Arts Department of Beijing University, art historians from the Central Conservatory of Music and Lishui University took part in the study. According to the study purpose, it was found that in traditional Chinese vocal arts, the main technique is falsetto (58%), mixed techniques (21.2%), vibrato (13.2%), overtone singing (6.1%), and glissando (1.5%) are also used. In popular singing the key technique is splitting (33.6%), also used: subtone (20.2%), vibrato (17.7%), drive (12.1%), glissando (11.1%), vocal fry register (9.2%), falsetto (3.3%), overtone singing (2%). As a result of the correlation analysis the dependence of popular singing techniques on traditional singing was determined. The coefficient of determination was 33.5%. It was also determined that when performing pop music, vibrato is controlled; noises and growling tones are used in rock music; uncontrolled vibrato, falsetto, and mixed techniques are used in opera; nasal sounds and minimal vibrato are in folk/country music; clear diction, articulation, slides, and scatting in blues/jazz; rhythmic and nasal sounds in hip-hop. The experiment results can be used in pedagogy for teaching vocals in China and abroad, as part of cultural activities related to the organization of events such as festivals, concerts, tourist programs, theatrical performances, etc. © 2022 Universidade Federal de Goias.

Festival tourism attracts fans and event participants from all over the world. They can contribute not only to the tourism industries but also to local and regional economic development. This study focuses on how urban music festival tourism can successfully attract tourist participation. It explores the service needs and the critical factors that affect tourists’ favorable participation decisions. The SIA (Satisfaction Importance Analysis) approach was applied to evaluate the service performance aspects/criteria for urban music festival tourism. The study used the NRM (Network Relation Map) approach to determine the acceptation paths. This study also provides sustainable development strategies and suitable development paths through the SIA-NRM approach. The findings of this study reveal the ranking of importance of service attributes and performance qualities perceived by tourists of urban music festivals. It provides recommendations to the music festival organizers and for local governments’ strategic directions, leading to successful music festival tourism. © 2022 by the authors.

It is timely for tourism scholars to evaluate the growing phenomenon of outdoor music festivals, which are associated with participation in processes of social integration. The current study investigates the extent to which participating in an outdoor music festival affected participant levels of social integration. In line with the research purpose, a questionnaire was applied to the participants (N = 426) of the MillionFest’ 19 festival in Eskişehir, Turkey. The study results show that participation in the festival has a medium- and high-level effect on dimensions of social integration. It is found that participating in an outdoor music festival provides elements of bilateral relations, physical development, and emotional development. © 2023 Cognizant, LLC.",festival attendance;outdoor music festival;social integration;turkey,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Arcodia C., Whitford M., Festival attendance and the development of social capital, Journal of Convention & Event Tourism, 8, 2, pp. 1-18, (2007); Backman K., Backman S.

In so doing, the current study draws on two case studies namely Mawazine Festival Rhythms of the World (MFRW) and Marrakech International Film Festival (MIFF).

Investigating how this digital pivot interrupted festival-making practices is now important given that online and hybrid modes will potentially be used in conjunction with in-person events in the future. This task has relevance for rural areas where digital infrastructures can be under-developed. Yet, place-based, community-organised festivals can play a significant role in sustaining local communities. In this context, we explore the recent digital programming practices of music festivals in West Cork, Ireland. Methodologically, the study adopted a qualitative research design and generated data from fieldwork observations and in-depth interviews with festival practitioners in West Cork. This area was chosen for study because it is characterised by intensive arts and festival activity, high tourism activity, and a significant level of social change. The findings show that the ability of festivals to move practices online was variable and highly resource dependent. Overall, they suggest that in times of crisis the role of festivals became even more important than normal. Festivals played an important role in sustaining social connectivity, cultural participation and employment, with festival organisations demonstrating a strong sense of care and responsibility towards participants. © 2023 by the authors.",arts festival;covid-19;digital programming;ireland;online/hybrid;sustainable rural development,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Rentschler R., Boram L., COVID-19 and arts festivals: Whither transformation, J.

In the Coachella Valley, a desert region in Southern California, the warm and dry climate during winter months attracts seasonal visitors from Canada and northern US states (“snowbirds”). However, global warming may adversely impact the snowbird season and other tourist attractions through rising temperatures. We analyzed how increasing temperatures are likely to impact three key components of the tourism industry in the region: climate in the winter snowbird season, visitation at an outdoor tourist attraction, and the likelihood of extreme heat at an annual festival. We used statistically downscaled climate models to make predictions about future visitation to the region by calculating changing probabilities of extreme heat during the tourist season and local events. Our analysis predicts a shortened snowbird season, which we define as the time of year with daily maximum temperatures below a threshold of 30 °C, under two future climate scenarios and time periods. We find a nonlinear relationship between daily maximum temperatures and daily zoo visits, where visitation sharply declines after a threshold of 30 °C. Using this threshold, we predict a decrease in zoo visitation by up to 18% and a shortening of the snowbird season by up to 36% by the end of the century. We also predict an increased likelihood of extreme heat stress during the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",extreme heat;festival;projections;snowbird;tourism;zoo;tourist attractions;perception;tourism market;tourist attraction;tourist behavior;tourist destination,California;

This paper aims at examining the possibilities of preserving organs and organ music in Poland in an international context. As part of the study, an analysis of UNESCO lists was conducted. Furthermore, the organ-building assets in Poland and tourist products developed on their basis (including cultural trails dedicated to organs and organ museums) were studied. Attention was also drawn to other sites and forms of the organ of possible interest to tourists, and to the functioning of organ festivals during the COVID-19 pandemic and virtual organ projects implemented in that period. In addition, public awareness concerning the organ in Poland and Europe as well as organ festivals and other associated tourist products was examined. Finally, actions aimed at preserving Poland’s organ heritage were proposed with reference to practices in other European countries. It was concluded that one of the possible ways to integrate the conservation of organ heritage is a comprehensive approach through the landscape. Organs and their music also form a part of the local landscape, both as landforms reminiscent of the instruments and as artistic installations and sounds, shaping a sense of local and regional identity. It is also very important to engage in cross-border cooperation (including an exchange of good practices) and educational projects with regard to the safeguarding of organ heritage. © 2022, Muzeologia a kulturne dedicstvo, o.z.

The study's qualitative research method involved conducting interviews and observations, and the use of qualitative research design grounded in ethnomusicological theory and philosophical and religious frameworks. A purposive sampling technique was used to identify participants comprising musicians, community leaders, artisans, religious figures, and elders having extensive knowledge about Lusheng traditions. A thematic content analysis approach was used to analyze the data collected. The results of the study reveals that the Miao and Dong communities deeply integrate one Lusheng instrument, a traditional reed-pipe, into their cultural, spiritual, and social fabric. The research highlights Lusheng's significance in religious ceremonies such as funerals and the Drum Zang Festival, where it functions as a sacred medium, facilitating communication with ancestors and deities. Philosophically, Lusheng music embodies communal unity, continuity and the interconnectedness of life and death. Economically, Lusheng music supports local artisans and performers, contributing to the region's economy through its production and performance during festivals and tourist attractions. Educationally, Lusheng music fosters cultural identity, religious understanding, and artistic expression, ensuring its transmission across generations. Through formal and informal educational programs, the Lusheng remains a vibrant part of community life, blending tradition with creative innovation. The study underscores the importance of preserving Lusheng as both a cultural and spiritual artifact, enriching the lives of the Miao and Dong people while maintaining its relevance in the modern world. © (2024), (European Journal for Philosophy of Religion).

The aim was to understand how and to what extent a large-scale event can bring benefits to the territory and the rural development of an area with a great, though only partially exploited, tourism potential. To this end, we used an input–output model fed by a sample survey carried out among the visitors and by the balance sheet data of the festival organizers. In order to obtain accurate and not overinflated estimated expenditures, we asked visitors to self-report their motivation for attending the area (seaside tourism vs. festival), and then used their motivation as a weight to revise expenditures, thus providing a novel approach in impact assessment studies. The results show that the total economic impact reaches €28.8 million, triggered by a direct impact that, in the agro-industrial sector alone, amounts to €9 million. In addition, for 1€ public money invested in this event, 6.3€ is generated in the primary sector and in the food sector alone. Additionally, the estimated value of the sale of typical products amounts to €1.3 million. Hence, under certain conditions, major cultural events can bring significant benefits to the development of the territory, enhancing the whole agri-food value chain and favoring a more even distribution of the capital generated. This study is an important contribution to the literature, as it encourages the development of studies focusing on the specific spill-overs of tourism, not necessarily rural, on the agricultural, rural, and food sectors, which should interact more frequently with the economic system in general and with the touristic sector as well.

The aim of this study is to analyze whether the motivation to persist with music festivals will remain or whether the concept of the music festival should be reinvented. Through a mixed-method approach, this study depicts motivations, perceptions, and behavioral intentions of attending traditional or online festivals with a structural equation model. Content analysis helps to further examine the attitudes of festivalgoers in the new contexts. They feel safe in traditional festivals if screening units and limited access is implemented, but if social pleasure is to be kept, music festivals should turn to online formats that allow interaction among participants. As such it can be concluded that in this new context, traditional music festivals are still a possibility if safety is ensured; nevertheless, online festivals seem to be the most obvious solution at least while the pandemic situation endures.

Using dual methodological approaches of fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) and structural equations modeling (SEM), it seeks to establish the EQ’s construct and predictive validity. Design/methodology/approach: Grounded in cross-sectional and online research design, the present study surveyed 881 attendees of an annual music festival (Malakoff) held in Norway and subjected the quantitative data to SEM and fsQCA. Findings: Both SEM and fsQCA confirmed the socializing and enjoyment dimensions of EQ, with good validity and reliability, as well as the functional and emotional value dimensions explaining visitors’ perceived value of attending a festival. Both statistical analyses also showed that perceived value-derived satisfaction leads to behavioral intention regarding festival visits. Practical implications: This study provides numerous valuable consequences for festival organizers, or marketers that can aid in developing effective strategies to measure visitors’ perceived quality of experience and numerous practical implications for festival organizers or marketers can help in developing effective strategies to measure visitors’ perceived quality of experience and then increase value perceptions, satisfaction and behavioral intentions toward attending festivals. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is among the first to adopt a dual-dimensional framework to measure EQ in festivals and establish its utility with two statistical approaches (SEM and fsQCA). It also shows the utility of perceived value, initially developed for adventure tourists, to study visitors’ experience with festivals. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",behavioral intention;experience marketing;experience quality;fsqca;perceived value,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"As,an K., Kaptangil K., Kinay A.G., Mediating role of perceived festival value in the relationship between experiences and satisfaction, International Journal of Event and Festival Management, 11, 2, pp. 255-271, (2020);

Some tourists and residents, the so-called festival goers, participate and come back to these events, whereas others, the non-goers, never participate and are not willing to do so. The aim of this research is to understand the decision to participate or not based on facilitators and constraints to participate or not in a music festival, dismantling residents and tourists' attitudes. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 1,178 music festival goers and non-goers in Portugal. Content analysis was undertaken to depict the most important determinants of their decisions. Those determinants were categorized according to the three dimensions of factors of ecological systems theory, considering festival goers and non-goers as well as tourists and residents. Findings: The results suggested that although constraints are not as often voiced as facilitators, both influence decisions that are expressed as delaying, postponing, avoiding or complying with others by participating in these events. Furthermore, the results suggested that the decision to participate or not depends on the social contexts of the festival goers or non-goers, and that these social contexts may invert their decision, be it by facilitating or constraining their participation. Research limitations/implications: This research is limited to festivals in Portugal and used a qualitative analysis that may be confirmed in other countries with quantitative methods. Nevertheless, this research opens paths to discuss facilitators and constraints through ecological system theory and gives insights into this industry. Practical implications: The results provide important insights for festival organizers to retain and build long-term relationships with festival goers. The results also provide insights into how to overcome the resistance which non-goers demonstrated. Social implications: This research offers an in-depth and insightful understanding of individuals' attitudes towards music festivals, allowing festival demand to be better understood. Furthermore, this research proves that attendance of music festivals is mostly a socially driven behaviour. Originality/value: By eliciting facilitators and constraints of the decision to participate in music festivals, considering residents and tourists, festival goers and non-goers, this study provides a deeper understanding of the decision to participate, through a theoretical framework which is rarely applied in this field. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",constraints;content analysis;facilitators;music festival;portugal;tourist,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Alexandris K., Tsorbatzoudis C., Grouios G., Perceived constraints on recreational sport participation: investigating their relationship with intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation and amotivation, Journal of Leisure Research, 34, 3, pp. 233-252, (2002); Blesic I., Pivac T., Stamenkovic I., Besermenji S., Markovic S., Investigation of visitor motivation of the exit music festival (The Republic of Serbia), Revista de turism-studii si cercetari in turism, 18, pp. 8-15, (2014); Bowen H.E., Daniels M.J., Does the music matter?

Design/methodology/approach: Participant observation and 20 in-depth semi structured interviews were conducted with the visiting musicians at the Kurahashi East-West Music Festival on Kurahashi-jima in Hiroshima Prefecture. A qualitative analysis approach using thematic coding, grounded in social exchange theory, was employed to examine the perspectives of the participants. Findings: The findings identified seven key themes related to motivation: performing and interacting with fellow musicians, for leisure performing or “fun”, providing a cultural experience to the community, participating for tourism purposes, because of sense of belonging to the destination, to collaborate with a prominent musician, and loyalty and commitment to a performance group. The results demonstrated that leisure performance and musician interaction were the most dominant themes in terms of motivation, while the importance of the other themes varied. Originality/value: By employing social exchange theory at a micro-level, this study delved deeper into the motivations perceived by visiting performing musicians at music festivals and their implications for community revitalization. The insights gained from this research provide valuable implications for festival organizers, performers and community leaders to tailor music festivals for community revitalization. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",community revitalization;motivations;music festival;social exchange theory;visitor perceptions,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Adderley C., Kennedy M., Berz W., A home away from home’: the world of the high school music classroom, Journal of Research in Music Education, 51, 3, pp. 190-205, (2003); Ap J., Residents' perceptions on tourism impacts, Annals of Tourism Research, 19, 4, pp. 665-690, (1992); Beck R.J., Cesario T.C., Yousefi A., Enamoto H., Choral singing, performance perception, and immune system changes in salivary immunoglobin A and cortisol, Music Perception, 18, 1, pp. 87-106, (2000); Brinberg D., Castell P., A resource exchange theory approach to interpersonal interactions: a test of Foa's theory, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 43, 2, pp. 260-269, (1982); Castro-Martinez E., Recasens A., Fernandez-de-Lucio I., Innovation in early music festivals: domains, strategies and outcomes, Managing Cultural Festivals: Tradition and Innovation in Europe, pp. 74-86, (2022); Chhabra D., Social exchange theory in resort and non-resort casino settings, Anatolia, 19, 1, pp. 155-160, (2008); Chiciudean D.I., Harun R., Muresan I.C., Arion F.H., Chiciudean G.O., Rural community-perceived benefits of a music festival, Societies, 11 No. 2, (2021); Christenson P.G., Roberts D.F., It's Not Only Rock and Roll: Popular Music in the Lives of Adolescents, (1998); Clift S., Hancox G., The perceived benefits of singing: findings from preliminary surveys of a university college choral society, Journal of the Royal Society for the Promotion of Health, 121, 4, pp. 248-256, (2001); Coffman D.D., Adamek M., The contributions of wind band participation to quality of life of senior adults, Music Therapy Perspectives, 17, 1, pp. 27-31, (1999); Connell J., Gibson C., Music and Tourism: on the Road Again, (2005); Creighton M., Changing heart (beats): from Japanese identity and nostalgia to Taiko for citizens of the Earth, East-West Identities: Globalization, Localization, and Hybridization, pp. 203-228, (2007); Dillette A., Douglas A., Martin D.S., O'Neill M., Resident perceptions on cross-cultural understanding as an outcome of volunteer tourism programs: the Bahamian Family Island perspective, Journal of Sustainable Tourism, 25, 9, pp. 1222-1239, (2017); Dodds R., Novonty M., Harper S., Shaping our perception of reality: sustainability communication by Canadian festivals, International Journal of Event and Festival Management, 11, 4, pp. 473-492, (2020); Druckman J., Krauze Z., Roberts D., Downes E.O., Vermeulen E., Aspen and Tanglewood, (1978); Dujmovic M., Vitasovic A., Festivals, local communities and tourism, Conference Proceedings Soundtracks: Music, Tourism and Travel Conference.

Through a case study of Mayday, a popular Chinese- Taiwanese band, this paper conducted qualitative research and collected multiple sources of data through netnography, participant-observation, semi-structured interviews and secondary data to reveal the embodied experience of young participants travelling across China to attend live pop concerts to be ‘right here, right now’. From the perspective of embodied experiences, this study finds that the allure of live pop lies in providing space for participants to be immersed in the body that lets go, to be present, be in unison, and forget. In this way, participants can gain aesthetic pleasure, sense of authenticity, tacit understanding and immersion, which are embodied experiences that cannot be replicated by other musical experiences and digitalization. The paper also provides theoretical and practical considerations for tourism practitioners to improve the experience for both live concert audiences and armchair audiences watching the recorded live concerts at home or in cinemas. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",body;china;concert;embodied experience;live music;qualitative analysis;tourism,China; digitization; qualitative analysis; theoretical study; tourism,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Andrews H., Feeling at home: Embodying Britishness in a Spanish charter tourist resort, Tourist Studies, 5, 3, pp. 247-266, (2005); Bennett A., “Let me know you’re out there!” Male rock vocal and audience participation, Perspectives on males and singing.

Using evidence from detailed ethnographic fieldwork, with musicians, festival organisers, tour operators, business owners and civil servants, this paper examines how issues such as geographical and social distance, internet connectivity, and cultural tourism are understood in relation to the musical life of Argyll and Bute. We advocate for greater ethnographic engagement with local communities in order to provide a more sophisticated, real-world understanding of rural cultural policy and the impact of current policies on local musicians. The paper therefore foregrounds ethnography as an important method in local, rural contexts such as Argyll and Bute, where typically, much of the creative economy is embedded in statistically invisible economic and cultural activity and portfolio employment. © 2021 The Author(s).

Fourteen qualitative, semistructured interviews were conducted with arts festival organizers, tourism representatives, and local volunteers during the summer festival season. The findings offer new insights into the factors affecting how arts festivals impact the local economy, the areas of the local economy that are affected by arts festivals, and the implications of funding from awarding bodies on the endogenous development of arts festivals. For instance, it is concluded that supporting the cultural values of locals is vital to the economic success of rural arts festivals through a strategic design in the combined integration of minimized paid staff and maximized volunteers. Furthermore, it is revealed how in certain cases the initial retention of funding may benefit start-up arts festivals in terms of strategic development of their social approval and natural progression. Through the provision of an original theoretical framework for the relationship between arts festivals and economic development in a rural island context, the article also makes substantive contributions to theoretical development and knowledge advancement in this field, while offering future research directions for rural studies researchers. Ultimately, island community practitioners such as festival directors, local authorities, and merchants could benefit from using the findings to develop enhanced strategic operations, which could generate greater synergies and sustainability for the local arts festival sector and ultimately contribute towards greater economic prosperity.

This will be done by increasing local spending and international tourism. This study seeks to understand how the MDL Beast music festival (held in December 2019 in Riyadh) was utilized by Saudi Arabia to portray its new image to the world through Instagram (a social media site). A mixed-method approach was used for qualitative research that interviewed three of the main MDL Beast festival organizers and analyzed 100 Instagram posts using the framing analysis method. Opening up to the world, positive change, and national pride were the most common frames to promote a new image of Saudi Arabia through the MDL Beast festival. MDL Beast festival sends the message that Saudi Arabia no longer confirms stereotypical conservative perceptions and has been changing. © 2022 The Author(s).

Drawing upon a 3-year ethnography (including fieldnotes, photos/videos, artifact material) and interviews with festival attendees, we explore the interrelationships between authenticity and extraordinary experiences in the context of Primavera Sound music festival. Our emergent thematic categories—the festival’s indie music character, its urban and quotidian configuration, and the instrumental orientation of the festival experience—suggest the festival is firmly positioned within the structures of the indie music industry, while also being located within the confines of day-to-day urban life. Attendees seek to achieve a sense of spatial authenticity by engaging with the features of tourism destinations. We contribute to discussions about authenticity and extraordinary experiences by unpacking the everyday nature of tourism destinations, demonstrating that not all music festivals need to be “extraordinary” muddy camping events. © The Author(s) 2023.",authenticity;music festival;popular music;tourism destinations;tourist experiences;music;tourism development;tourist attraction;tourist destination,music; spatiotemporal analysis; tourism development; tourist attraction; tourist destination,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Abrahams R., Ordinary and extraordinary experience, The anthropology of experience, pp. 45-73, (1986); Anderton C., Music festival sponsorship: Between commerce and carnival, Arts Marketing An International Journal, 1, 2, pp. 145-158, (2011); Anderton C., Music festivals in the UK: Beyond the carnivalesque, (2018); Arnould E.J., Price L.L., River magic: Extraordinary experience and the extended service encounter, Journal of Consumer Research, 20, 1, pp. 24-45, (1993); Braun V., Clarke V., Using thematic analysis in psychology, Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, 2, pp. 77-101, (2006); Bryce D., Murdy S., Alexander M., Diaspora, authenticity and the imagined past, Annals of Tourism Research, 66, pp. 49-60, (2017); Canavan B., McCamley C., Negotiating authenticity: Three modernities, Annals of Tourism Research, 88, (2021); Chaney D., Goulding C., Dress, transformation, and conformity in the heavy rock subculture, Journal of Business Research, 69, 1, pp. 155-165, (2016); Chhabra D., Defining authenticity and its determinants: Toward an authenticity flow model, Journal of Travel Research, 44, 1, pp. 64-73, (2005); Cohen E., Rethinking the sociology of tourism, Annals of Tourism Research, 6, 1, pp. 18-35, (1979); Cohen E., Cohen S.A., Current sociological theories and issues in tourism, Annals of Tourism Research, 39, 4, pp. 2177-2202, (2012); Coskuner-Balli G., Thompson C.J., The status costs of subordinate cultural capital: At-home fathers’ collective pursuit of cultural legitimacy through capitalizing consumption practices, Journal of Consumer Research, 40, 1, pp. 19-41, (2013); Crotty S., The foundations of social research, (1998); Daskalopoulou A., Skandalis A., Consumption field driven entrepreneurship (CFDE): How does membership in the indie music field shape individuals’ entrepreneurial journey, European Journal of Marketing, 53, 1, pp. 63-82, (2019); Daskalopoulou A., Skandalis A., Music festivals and the everyday nature of extraordinary experiences, Marketing the arts, pp. 126-138, (2022); Delaney B., Trend watch: Aging festival goers, (2007); Featherstone M., The flâneur, the city and virtual public life, Urban Studies, 35, 5, pp. 909-925, (1998); Fox D., Edwards J., Wilkes K., Employing the grand tour approach to aid understanding of garden visiting, Cultural tourism research methods, pp. 75-86, (2010); Frisch T., Sommer C., Stoltenberg L., Stors N., Tourism and everyday life in the contemporary city, (2019); Goolaup S., Nunkoo R., Reconceptualizing tourists’ extraordinary experiences, Journal of Travel Research, 62, pp. 399-411, (2023); Goulding C., Saren M., Transformation, transcendence, and temporality in theatrical consumption, Journal of Business Research, 69, 1, pp. 216-223, (2016); Goulding C., Shankar A., Elliott R., Canniford R., The marketplace management of illicit pleasure, Journal of Consumer Research, 35, 5, pp. 759-771, (2009); Heller A., Everyday life, (1984); Hesmondhalgh D., Indie: The institutional politics and aesthetics of a popular music genre, Cultural Studies, 13, 1, pp. 34-61, (1999); Hietanen J., Rokka J., Market practices in countercultural market emergence, European Journal of Marketing, 49, 9-10, pp. 1563-1588, (2015); Higgins L., Hamilton K., Pilgrimage, material objects and spontaneous communitas, Annals of Tourism Research, 81, (2020); Hunter-Tilney L., Rock festivals grow old gracefully, Financial Times, (2018); Husemann K.C., Eckhardt G.M., Grohs R., Saceanu R.E., The dynamic interplay between structure, anastructure and antistructure in extraordinary experiences, Journal of Business Research, 69, 9, pp. 3361-3370, (2016); Kerrigan F., Larsen G., Hanratty S., Korta K., ‘Gimme shelter’: Experiencing pleasurable escape through the musicalisation of running, Marketing Theory, 14, 2, pp. 147-166, (2014); Kim H., Jamal T., Touristic quest for existential authenticity, Annals of Tourism Research, 34, 1, pp. 181-201, (2007); Knudsen D.C., Rickly J.M., Vidon E.S., The fantasy of authenticity: Touring with Lacan, Annals of Tourism Research, 58, pp. 33-45, (2016); Kozinets R.V., Can consumers escape the market?

Taking the Mexefest festival in Lisbon as a case in point, this article asks how, in the digital streaming era, music festivals in urban environments are framed, curated and experienced. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork, our analysis examines how music festival programmers curate the urban festival experience, for both locals and tourists alike. First, we identify the emergence of urban music festivals in recent decades, and how modern festival programmes have adopted the cultural technique of the ‘shuffle mode’ as an influential principle. Second, we investigate the work of festival programmers through the lens of ‘cultural intermediaries’, and ask how their programming strategies, particularly through digital mobile media (such as music playlists), contribute to an aestheticised experience of the city during the festival. Third, we focus on how the Mexefest festival events are staged in tandem with brand activation by sponsors like mobile phone company Vodafone and their radio station Vodafone FM. In doing so, we highlight the participation of festival-goers through their embodied engagements with digital media, music listening and urban space, and evaluate the heuristic value of ‘shuffle curation’ as a tool for the understanding of music festivals as a distinctly global and networked form of leisure consumption in urban culture. © The Author(s) 2021.",commercial radio;cultural intermediaries;cultural studies;digital music curation;listening audiences;music festival;urban studies,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Anderton C., (Re)Constructing Music Festival Places, (2006); Aquino L., Picture Ahead: A Kodak E a Construção Do Turista-fotógrafo, (2016); Barna E., The perfect guide in a crowded musical landscape: Online music platforms and curatorship, First Monday, 22, 4, pp. 1-15, (2017); Barriere L., Finkel R., The material culture of music festival fandoms, European Journal of Cultural Studies, (2020); Bauman Z., Liquid Modernity, (2000); Bauman Z., Culture in a Liquid Modern World, (2011); Bennett A., Taylor J., Woodward I., The Festivalization of Culture, (2014); Birdsall C., (In)audible frequencies: Sounding out the contemporary branded city, Paris–Amsterdam Underground.

For them the classic tourist attractions are not satisfying and interesting anymore. The aim of the paper was to examine the measurement methods for sharing experiences related to these festivals and tourist programmes, and understand how other tourists use these shared experiences during the information gathering phase. The methodology is based on literature review and quantitative primary research. A structured questionnaire was used for the quantitative research focusing on the motivations of sharing travel experience and sources of information gathering. The data were collected by means of an on line survey via LimeSurvey, and descriptive statistics was used to interpret the acquired data. As a result of the quantitative research, three different groups of Hungarian youngsters visiting local music festivals were formed. For them, sharing that experience means different things: some only create memories for themselves, some try to create valuable content that may help others, and some want to become a social media celebrity. They use social media and they also gather information in a different way. Knowing how these groups use social media to share experiences and to get information are key factors for marketing managers in order to use an efficient communication method with each group. It is also an important factor to understand the differences in people’s motivations with the aim to create a well-planned marketing campaign. © 2021, Wroclaw University of Economics.

Programs that last several days also mean significant financial burden for young people, so they gather information from multiple sources before decision-making. The purpose of the study is to examine which information sources - especially social media - and which motivations have become significant in the context of festival tourism's decision process. An online survey was conducted as part of and exploratory research over four consecutive years dealing with the use of information sources and the importance of the music festivals' characteristics targeting the Hungarian Generation Z attendees of festivals. Besides the descriptive statistics cluster analysis and ANOVA tables were used. It can be emphasized that in the case of festival tourism, the influence and usage of social media, relying on the opinions of acquaintances and friends is much more significant in the decision-making phase than in the case of traditional tourism. The program and the leading performers are not the only important factors, but meeting friends, the atmosphere of the festival, and reasonable value for money are also significant. Three groups of users could be identified: those who are mainly browsing official websites and search engines, those who try to make decisions based on earlier experiences, and those who are also looking at social media sites and digest several types of content to make the decision. Organisers of festivals should understand the differences among these groups to create better communication strategies. © 2021 Budapest University of Technology and Economics.

A conceptual model was developed based on an extensive literature review. The survey was conducted among 514 tourists who attended music festivals in Morocco and structural equation modelling based on the PLS method was used to validate the research model. The results show that the image of the event has a direct and positive impact on the image of the destination, providing empirical support for the theory of image transfer. Destination image is a significant predictor of behavioural intention, and destination image mediates between event image and behavioural intention towards the host city. These results can help destination marketers to make more proactive use of events in destination management. The study developed a distinct model and focused on music festivals, which is new because most of the other studies on the subject have concentrated on a single event, usually a sporting event. © 2022 AJHTL /Author(s) | Open Access – Online @ www.ajhtl.com",behavioral intention;destination image;event image;image transfer;tourism,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Alcaniz E.B., Sanchez I.S., Blas S.S., The Functional-Psychological Continuum in the Cognitive Image of a Destination: A Confirmatory Analysis, Tourism Management, 30, 5, pp. 715-723, (2009); Allameh M.

During the past two decades there has been a spectacular boom in new forms of worship of Ganesha, the elephant-headed god of success and remover of obstacles. At these ostensibly religious events and festivals, Thai followers wear Indian clothing and consume Indian foods. Processions incorporate Indian music ensembles and dancers for accompaniment, entertainment and ambience. Through analysis of three Ganesha-sponsoring institutions, together with interviews and ethnography among both institution owners and patrons in Chiang Mai, Thailand, this article examines the role of Indian-tagged symbolic accoutrements as part of a religious experience for Thai people today. As this article argues, while Ganesha is central to the cult, and indeed, the main event, these accoutrements serve the dual purpose of creating a visual/visceral experience of cultural tourism of Indian-ness for Thai worshippers and catering to the needs of Ganesha as an Indian god in the eyes of Thais. © 2021 Asian Studies Association of Australia.",accoutrements;chiang mai;consumerism;ganesha;hinduism;religious spectacle;thailand;tourism,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Agarwal R., Jones W.J., Ganesa and his cult in contemporary Thailand, International Journal of Asia–Pacific Studies, 14, 2, pp. 122-138, (2018); Antony M.G., On the spot: Seeking acceptance and expressing resistance through the, bindi.

This paper develops a case study of four videos realised by the Louth County Board of the organisation Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann (CCÉ) in Co. Louth, Ireland, as a part of the FleadhFest 2021 initiative. It highlights the role that virtual spaces have in enhancing a sense of belonging to a music/festival community as well as the possibility that visual and audio supports have in promoting and celebrating a destination and its cultural features. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis involves a netnographic examination of these videos (Janta, 2017), informed by the concept of “tourist gaze” (Urry, 1990; 2002) and influenced by film-induced tourism studies (Beeton, 2005). Findings: Results show how festival and event organisers responded to COVID-19 social restrictions by creating a virtual space for celebrating music heritage and local musicscape, placing an emphasis on local musical scene. Research limitations/implications: The research aims to inform future developments in how the organisation operates within and engages with virtual space, its members and a wider audience. Originality/value: This is the first study to consider the virtual activities of CCÉ from an ethnomusicological as well as tourism, perspective. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",film-induced tourism;irish traditional music;music events;virtual and hybrid events,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Anderson B.R.O., Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism, (2006); Ardevol E., Virtual/visual ethnography: methodological crossroads at the intersection of visual and Internet research, Advances in Visual Methodology, pp. 74-94, (2012); Arnold N., Festival tourism: recognizing the challenges; linking multiple pathways between global villages of the new century, Tourism in the 21st Century.

Design/methodology/approach: We use a community-based participatory framework to guide this study, and qualitative research methods in the form of in-depth interviews and surveys at three separate music festivals within the interior of British Columbia, Canada. Findings: The majority of patrons are aware of the environmental impacts of music festivals and are more likely to attend a festival with effective practices. By making environmental sustainability a core value of the festival and communicating environmental objectives with both stakeholders and patrons, managers can begin to alleviate the operational barriers to environmentalism. Originality/value: One of the primary contributions of this study is that it provides management with deeper understandings of a wide range of barriers to effective environmental practices in Western Canada. We consult directly with both festival management and attendees about environmental practices. This paper presents a fuller perspective of how to move beyond simple measures and craft a more sophisticated and flexible environmental strategy that reduces risk, anticipates obstacles and greatly improves the odds of successful implementation. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",community-based research;environmental practices;music festival;stakeholder relationships;sustainability;tourism industries,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ablah E., Brown J., Carroll B., Bronleewe T., A community-based participatory research approach to identifying environmental concerns, Journal of Environmental Health, 79, 5, pp. 14-19, (2016); Alonso-Vazquez M., Factors that influence engagement in on-site environmentally responsible behaviours at music festivals, pp. 1-260, (2015); Anderson L.M., Bateman T.S., Individual environmental initiative: championing natural environmental issues in US business organizations, Academy of Management Journal, 43, 4, pp. 548-570, (2000); Andersson T.D., Getz D., Stakeholder management strategies of festivals, Journal of Convention and Event Tourism, 9, 3, pp. 199-220, (2008); Andersson T.D., Lundberg E., Commensurability and sustainability: triple impact assessments of a tourism event, Tourism Management, 37, pp. 99-109, (2013); Andersson T.D., Getz D., Tourism as a mixed industry: differences between private, public and not-for-profit festivals, Tourism Management, 30, 6, pp. 847-856, (2009); Andersson T.D., Getz D., Mykletun J., Jaeger K., Dolles H., Factors influencing grant and sponsorship revenue for festivals, Event Management, 17, 3, pp. 195-212, (2013); Bachman J.R., Backman K.F., Norman W.C., A segmentation of volunteers at the 2013 Austin city limits music festival: insights and future directions, Journal of Convention and Event Tourism, 15, 4, pp. 298-315, (2014); Bachman J.R., Norman W.C., Hopkins C.D., Brookover R.S., Examining the role of self-concept theory on motivation, satisfaction, and intent to return of music festival volunteers, Event Management, 20, 1, pp. 41-52, (2016); Ballantyne J., Ballantyne R., Packer J., Designing and managing music festival experiences to enhance attendees' psychological and social benefits, Musicae Scientiae, 18, 1, pp. 65-83, (2014); Banerjee B., McKeage K., How green is my value: exploring the relationships between environmentalism and materialism, Advances in Consumer Research, 21, 1, pp. 147-152, (1994); Barber N.A., Kim Y.H., Barth S., The importance of recycling to U.S. festival visitors: a preliminary study, Journal of Hospitality Marketing and Management, 23, 6, pp. 601-625, (2014); Blesic I., Pivac T., Stamenkovic I., Besermenji S., Markovic S., Investigation of visitor motivation of the exit music festival (the republic of Serbia), Revista De Turism - Studii Si Cercetari in Turism, 18, pp. 8-15, (2014); Bowen H.E., Daniels M.J., Does the music matter?

In post-colonial coastal cities, these strands are part of a larger musical space carved out by the legacies of colonial cultural transmission and subsequent assimilation into aspirational European cosmopolitan tropes. I examine the shifting engagement of Western classical choirs in the context of two coastal cities: Goa in India and Colombo (with a focus on Negombo) in Sri Lanka. Combining in-depth interviews with two choral conductors alongside the predicament of musical production in the digital space, I argue that choral music impinges on a notion of personal intimacy that combines a collective sense of creativity and community, organically linked to Catholic landscapes animated by a ‘Catholic affect’. © 2022 South Asian Studies Association of Australia.",catholic landscapes;choirs;coast;covid-19;goa;sri lanka;india;festival;music,Colombo [Western Province]; Goa; India; Sri Lanka; Western Province [Sri Lanka]; Catholicism; COVID-19; festival; music,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"S.

Individual blood alcohol concentration is measured with electronic breathalyzers. The experimental games are payoff-equivalent private property and common property trust games. We find that alcohol consumption is associated with less sharing in the private property game and lower efficiency in the common property game. There is a game-form effect for sober participants who share less in the common property game than in the private property game. This finding is consistent with revealed altruism theory as more sharing reveals more altruistic behavior. The absence of such game-form effect among non-sober participants is consistent with alcohol myopia. Tourists share more than local residents, significantly so for sober participants. The private property game elicits more efficiency than the common property game.

Design/methodology/approach: The research hypotheses were tested with a sample of 272 millennial participants attending the Borneo Jazz Festival held in Miri, Sarawak. Findings: The results indicated that program content and facility are crucial predictors of millennial participants' level of satisfaction with the event. Furthermore, the level of satisfaction would, in turn, affect their intention to revisit the event and spread positive word-of-mouth.

Other artistic forms, cultural practices and festivals are involved in self-reflexive efforts to confront their own pasts; such are discussed as varying processes of the decolonisation of knowledge and culture. This provides the critical and cultural context for consideration of the jazz festival in the Georgian urban centre. Preliminary analysis of relevant jazz festivals’ programmes, commissions and concerts leads to interrogating the relationship–of silence, of place–between jazz in Britain, historic or heritage locations and venues, and the degree or lack of understanding of the transatlantic slave trade. The heritage centres clearly associated with the slave trade that also have significant (jazz) festivals referred to include Bristol, Cheltenham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Hull, Lancaster, Liverpool, London, and Manchester. © 2018, © 2018 George McKay.

House music–a specific form of electronic music – represents a current trend in the UK, and this paper explores the nature of its consumption as a live event experience different to other types of music events. It aims to demonstrate the unique reality of an event as a combination of experiences (e.g. Petterson & Getz, 2009. Event Experiences in Time and Space: A Study of Visitors to the 2007 World Alpine Ski Championships in Åre, Sweden. Scandinavian Journal of Hospitality and Tourism, 9(2-3), 308–326.); arguably this can only be truly conceptualised by the individual, and so the ‘Event Experience Mapping Model’ (EEMM) methodology has been designed to conceptualise an individual’s sensory and emotional ‘immersion’ within the eventscape. This is done primarily in the context of recreational habits, emotional responses and social engagement, thus combining multiple facets of event experience within one study in the milieu of twenty-first century house music. The EEMM used a questionnaire to garner broad themes associated with this event type; this produced an ‘Experience Matrix’ which can then be completed by an individual to produce an individual ‘Experience Map’. Key to this principle is that this ‘map’ this will differ from person to person and thus the EEMM allows for this to be expressed in an individual ‘map’. The map demonstrates the intersections of four aspects of experience and thus plots which aspects are more/ less prevalent within that individual’s experience. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",event experience;experience mapping;house music;music events;phenomenology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"(2019);

This paper addresses the ways in which music, when understood as intangible heritage, may be used for place making and nation branding purposes, and the dynamic between these two processes, as seen from the perspective of cultural and heritage tourism workers. To analyze this dynamic, we focus on the genre of Slovenian folk-pop music. Invented in the 1950s, it has since then become the prevalent (popular) musical element of the Slovenian cultural landscape, while its variants have also, and in parallel to ‘national’ characterization of the genre, been appropriated in various local contexts. We trace how Slovenian folk pop simultaneously partakes in the construction of the country’s national brand and in local place making strategies of heritage promotion, deployed by national, regional, and local stakeholders. We draw on an extensive literature review, document analysis, and interviews with folk-pop festival organizers. Based on this initial mapping of the major stakeholders, we propose a classification of folk-pop music festivals that accounts for the different ways in which folk pop is used as an instrument of heritage tourism, place making, nation branding, and entertainment industries. © 2023 The Author(s).

The study involved the analysis of 57 urinary biomarkers of PS in raw municipal wastewater samples collected in three characteristic periods, including the festival week in the peak-tourist season (July) and reference weeks in the peak-tourist season (August) and the off-tourist season (November). Such a large number of biomarkers allowed the recognition of distinct patterns of PS use associated with the festival, but also revealed some subtle differences between summer and autumn seasons. The festival week was characterized by markedly increased use of illicit stimulants (MDMA: 30-fold increase; cocaine and amphetamine: 1.7-fold increase) and alcohol (1.7-fold increase), while consumption of other common illicit drugs (cannabis and heroin), major therapeutic opioids (morphine, codeine and tramadol) and nicotine remained rather constant. Interestingly, NPS and methamphetamine clearly contributed to the festival PS signature in wastewater, but their prevalence was rather low compared to that of common illicit drugs. Estimates of cocaine and cannabis use were largely consistent with prevalence data from national surveys, whereas differences were found for typical amphetamine-type recreational drugs, particularly MDMA, and for heroin. The WBE data suggest that the largest proportion of morphine came from heroin consumption and that the percentage of heroin users seeking treatment in Split is probably rather low. The prevalence of smoking calculated in this study (30.6 %) was consistent with national survey data for 2015 (27.5–31.5 %), while the average alcohol consumption per capita >15 years (5.2 L) was lower than sales statistics suggest (8.9 L). © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",cotinine;ethyl sulfate;illegal drugs;sewage epidemiology;substances of abuse;tobacco;wastewater-based epidemiology;music;croatia;alcohol;electronic music;tourism,"Amphetamine; Analgesics, Opioid; Cocaine; Ethanol; Heroin; Holidays; Humans; Illicit Drugs; Music; N-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine; Nicotine; Substance Abuse Detection; Substance-Related Disorders; Wastewater; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Croatia; Split; Biomarkers; Nicotine; Sulfur compounds; alcohol; amphetamine; biological marker; cannabis; central stimulant agent; codeine; cotinine; diamorphine; illicit drug; midomafetamine; nicotine; psychotropic agent; tramadol; alcohol; cocaine; diamorphine; illicit drug; midomafetamine; narcotic analgesic agent; nicotine; Consumption patterns; Cotinine; Electronic music; Ethyl sulfate; Illegal drugs; Illicit drug; Opioids; Sewage epidemiologies; Substance of abuse; Wastewater-based epidemiology; alcohol consumption; drug user; epidemiology; music; smoking; urine; wastewater; Article; autumn; cannabis use; controlled study; drug traffic; human; human activities; municipal wastewater; music; prevalence; sewage; smoking; Southern Europe; substance abuse; summer; tobacco; tourism; urine sampling; wastewater; wastewater-based epidemiology; water analysis; water sampling; drug dependence; leisure; wastewater; water pollutant; Sewage",NA,"alcohol, 64-17-5; amphetamine, 1200-47-1, 139-10-6, 156-34-3, 2706-50-5, 300-62-9, 51-62-7, 60-13-9, 60-15-1; cannabis, 8001-45-4, 8063-14-7; codeine, 76-57-3; cotinine, 486-56-6; diamorphine, 1502-95-0, 561-27-3; midomafetamine, 42542-10-9; nicotine, 54-11-5; tramadol, 27203-92-5, 36282-47-0; cocaine, 50-36-2, 53-21-4, 5937-29-1; Amphetamine, ; Analgesics, Opioid, ; Cocaine, ; Ethanol, ; Heroin, ; Illicit Drugs, ; N-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, ; Nicotine, ; Wastewater, ; Water Pollutants, Chemical,",NA,NA,"Andres-Costa M.J., Escriva U., Andreu V., Pico Y., Estimation of alcohol consumption during “Fallas” festivity in the wastewater of Valencia city (Spain) using ethyl sulfate as a biomarker, Sci.

There is extensive bibliography on the role played by culture in the forging of the so-called Barcelona model, but little attention has been paid thus far to popular music. Barcelona may lack Ibiza’s super-clubs, but, in the space of a generation, the city has gone from being a relative backwater to becoming a staple of major international tours, and music has increasingly become a popular tourist attraction. This is a logical albeit not necessarily intended consequence of Barcelona’s Olympic adventure. I begin with a preliminary survey of rock and pop concerts before exploring in the main section how and why live and recorded music performed a key but underexplored role in the success of the 1992 Olympic Games. A critical examination of the subsequent development of popular music in the Catalan capital will provide a means by which to grapple with the legacy of the Transition and Barcelona ’92 in post-recession Spain. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",barcelona;clubbing;ibiza;olympics;tourism,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Anttiroiko A.-V., The Political Economy of City Branding, (2014); Balibrea M.P., The Global Cultural Capital: Addressing the Citizen and Producing the City in Barcelona, (2017); Becerra J., Sotelino B.R., La Voz de Galicia, (2016); Bennett A., ‘Chilled Ibiza’: Dance Tourism and the Neo-Tribal Island Community, Island Musics, pp. 123-135, (2004); Berrozpe A., Campo S., Yague M.J., Understanding the Identity of Ibiza, Spain, Journal of Travel and Tourism Marketing, 34, 8, pp. 1033-1046, (2017); Berverley A., The Sid Vicious Family Album, (1980); Brewster B., Broughton F., Last Night a DJ Saved My Life: The History of the DJ, (2000); Brooks G., Lupton S., Freddie Mercury: His Own Life in his Own Words, (2008); Costa L., ¡Bacalao!

We also aim to describe festivalgoers’ characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected from 522 festivalgoers who attended the Rainforest World Music Festival (RWMF) in Malaysia. A two-stage cluster analysis of Ward’s method and k-means was applied to develop technographic segmentation during the festival. Using discriminant analysis, we confirmed that each festivalgoer’s characteristics differ amongst groups. Findings: Four technographic segments were developed: alarm hitters, technological tickers, plug pullers and fuse blowers. The results confirmed that festivalgoers had distinct characteristics and preferences based on smartphone use. Research limitations/implications: We extend previous research on the technographic segmentation of smartphones and festivalgoers. We highlighted the limitations of cluster analysis in terms of stability to produce a suitable number of segments and to include other festivals. The generalisability of the results may be constrained by the time gap between data collection and publication. Practical implications: Our results can help marketing managers understand the needs of segments by selecting appropriate advertisements and promotional tools that appeal directly to the desired target segments. Social implications: This study will help local communities increase their revenue and job opportunities. The culture of music festivals for the next generation can be sustained and promoted by local and international festival lovers. Originality/value: This study is the first to present festivalgoers' use of the technographic segmentation term in music festivals. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",cluster analysis;events;music festival;smartphone;technographic segmentation;tourism,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Baez A., Devesa M., Segmenting and profiling attendees of a film festival, International Journal of Event and Festival Management, 5, 2, pp. 96-115, (2014);

Drawing on the S-O-R model and situated cognition theory, a framework was proposed and tested through multilevel analysis with empirical evidence taken from an array of shows held within a festival at various heritage sites. Findings demonstrate a cross-level moderated mediated chain of relationship leading from co-developed festivalscape to an array of event and site outcomes through the mediation of co-developed experience. This research extends the stimulus-organism-response mechanism to conjecture the situated S-O-R model based on the situated cognition thesis. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",attachment;co-development;experience;festival;heritage;loyalty;music;s-o-r model;situated cognition;value,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ahn J., Kwon J., Green hotel brands in Malaysia: Perceived value, cost, anticipated emotion, and revisit intention, Current Issues in Tourism, 23, 12, pp. 1559-1574, (2020); Bagozzi R.P., Attitude formation under the theory of reasoned action and a purposeful behaviour reformulation, British Journal of Social Psychology, 25, 2, pp. 95-107, (1986); Bahm A.J., Axiology: The science of values, (1993); Benur A.M., Bramwell B., Tourism product development and product diversification in destinations, Tourism Management, 50, pp. 213-224, (2015); Berry L.L., Shankar V., Parish J.T., Cadwallader S., Dotzel T., Creating new markets through service innovation, MIT Sloan Management Review, 47, 2, (2006); Bitner M.J., Servicescapes: The impact of physical surroundings on customers and employees, Journal of Marketing, 56, 2, pp. 57-71, (1992); Bonn M.A., Joseph-Matthews S.M., Mo D., Hayes S., Cave J., Heritage/cultural attraction atmospherics: Creating the right environment for the heritage/cultural visitor, Journal of Travel Research, 45, 3, pp. 345-354, (2007); Bowlby J., Maternal care and mental health, 2, (1951); Campos A.C., Mendes J., Do Valle P.O., Scott N., Co-creation experiences: Attention and memorability, Journal of Travel & Tourism Marketing, 33, 9, pp. 1309-1336, (2016); Canavan B., McCamley C., Negotiating authenticity: Three modernities, Annals of Tourism Research, 88, (2021); Carneiro M.J., Eusebio C., Caldeira A., Santos A.C., The influence of eventscape on emotions, satisfaction and loyalty: The case of re-enactment events, International Journal of Hospitality Management, 82, pp. 112-124, (2019); Charton-Vachet F., Lombart C., Louis D., Impact of attitude towards a region on purchase intention of regional products: The mediating effects of perceived value and preference, International Journal of Retail & Distribution Management, 48, 7, pp. 707-725, (2020); Chen C.-F., Chen F.-S., Experience quality, perceived value, satisfaction and behavioral intentions for heritage tourists, Tourism Management, 31, 1, pp. 29-35, (2010); Cheng T.-M., Wu H.C., How do environmental knowledge, environmental sensitivity, and place attachment affect environmentally responsible behavior?

The development of the elliptical plan layout could give these places a capacity of up to 50,000 seats, being these sites mainly remembered for the shows and fights between gladiators and wild fears. Nowadays some of them are already preserved by hosting musical concerts and artistic performances, but many others, given the state of their ruins, are open to pleasant visits for tourists and amateurs but having no functional activities. This paper is going to illustrate the acoustic characteristics of the amphitheatre located in Santa Maria Capua Vetere nearby Naples. After an extensive acoustic and architectural measurement campaign, in the first instance, the authors present the analysis of the actual conditions as the monument is in its current state. Furthermore, a digital model has been realized in order to understand how the arena could be functioning with a musical performance. An acoustic shell located in the centre of the arena and composed of mountable reflecting panels is one of the options proposed by the authors to give life to this such a wonderful and historical place. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",acoustic shell;architectural acoustics;cultural heritage;musical performance;roman amphitheatre;music;cultural heritages;performance,Music; Acoustic shells; Acoustics design; Architectural buildings; Building types; Cultural heritages; Ellipticals; Musical performance; Performance; Plan layout; Roman amphitheater; Architectural acoustics,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gross P., L'architettura tomana.

The paper firstly reviews broadening definitions of cultural tourism, which now include more intangible, interactive and creative experiences. The research focuses on urban cultural tourism and the city of Budapest in Hungary. The primary data examines how motivated tourists are by different activities including culture; how far tourists are interested in heritage sites and museums compared to everyday culture and creative activities; it analyses variations in cultural activities according to age, gender and nationality; and the types of experiences that are desired the most by tourists. Cultural tourists still appear to be highly educated, but educational experiences are less important than escapism or entertainment. Cultural contact is important, but creative experiences are not. There are only small variations between genders and nationalities, but larger ones according to age groups. Older tourists prefer heritage sites and museums, whereas younger ones prefer night-life, music events and festivals. Overall, the findings are important for urban capital cities that have concerns about overtourism and the night-time economy, as well as the desire to re-establish themselves as cultural tourism destinations. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",budapest;city tourist;cultural tourism;tourist experience;tourist motivation;urban cultural tourist,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Beeton S., Film-induced tourism, (2005); Bonn M.A., Joseph-Mathews S.M., Dai M., Hayes S., Cave J., Heritage/cultural attraction atmospherics: Creating the right environment for the heritage cultural visitor, Journal of Travel Research, 45, 3, pp. 345-354, (2007); Buczkowska K., Turystyka kulturowa: Przewodnik metodyczny, (2008); Butler R., Hinch T., Tourism and indigenous peoples: Issues and implications, (2007); Chan T.W., Goldthorpe J.H., The social stratification of theatre, dance and cinema attendance, Cultural Trends, 14, 3, pp. 193-212, (2005); Chandralal L., Valenzuela F.-R., Exploring memorable tourism experiences: Antecedents and behavioural outcomes, Journal of Economics, Business and Management, 1, 2, pp. 177-181, (2013); Chang L.-L., Backman K.F., Huang Y.C., Creative tourism: A preliminary examination of creative tourists’ motivation, experience, perceived value and revisit intention, International Journal of Culture, Tourism and Hospitality Research, 8, 4, pp. 401-419, (2014); Chen G., Huang S., Understanding Chinese cultural tourists: Typology and profile, Journal of Travel & Tourism Marketing, 35, 2, pp. 162-177, (2018); Chen H., Rahman I., Cultural tourism: An analysis of engagement, cultural contact, memorable tourism experience and destination loyalty, Tourism Management Perspectives, 26, pp. 153-163, (2018); Diekmann A., Smith M.K., Ethnic and minority cultures as tourist attractions, (2015); Dolnicar S., A review of data-driven market segmentation in tourism, Journal of Travel & Tourism Marketing, 12, 1, pp. 1-22, (2002); du Cros H., McKercher B., Cultural tourism, (2015); Falk J.H., Ballantyne R., Packer J., Benckendorff P., Travel and learning: A neglected tourism research area, Annals of Tourism Research, 39, 2, pp. 908-927, (2012); Gibson C., Connell J., Music and tourism: On the road again, (2005); Gnoth J., Zins A.H., Developing a tourism cultural contact scale, Journal of Business Research, 66, 6, pp. 738-744, (2013); Kultúra és turizmus utazásra motiváló kulturalis látnivalók és programok, Turizmus Bulletin XII, 3, pp. 20-28, (2008); Huang S., (2017); Hughes H.L., Arts, entertainment and tourism, (2000); Kim J.-H., Brent Ritchie J.R., McCormick B., Development of a scale to measure memorable tourism experiences, Journal of Travel Research, 51, 1, pp. 12-25, (2010); Lopez-Sintas J., Garcia-Alvarez E., Omnivore versus univore consumption and its symbolic: Evidence from Spaniards’ performing arts attendance, Poetics, 32, pp. 463-483, (2004); Maitland R., Cultural tourism and the development of new tourism areas in London, Cultural tourism: Global and local perspectives, pp. 113-128, (2007); McKercher B., Cultural tourism market: A perspective paper, Tourism Review, (2020); McKercher B., du Cros H., Cultural tourism.

This qualitative- and action-based research explores the effects of artistic activities on rural revitalization through the analysis of four small-scale rural events: a traditional matsuri (festival), and three contemporary art, music, and film festivals. The adaptability and diversity of the festivals’ entrepreneurial networks are investigated in greater depth by combining the literatures on rural revitalization, social entrepreneurship, bricolage, and resourcefulness with the embedded and relational aspects of creative entrepreneurial networks. The study also analyzes the complex relationship between the individual actions of creative festival entrepreneurs and the socially engaged creative networks that facilitate population retention and resource exchanges in a community, and therefore rural revitalization. © 2023 Cognizant, LLC.

Music events present experiences centred around unique local culture and serve the trend toward growth in domestic tourism. However, there is a dearth of literature on music event tourism from the Continent despite Africa being known for its rich cultures and popularity of music. Although a globally popular musical style, choir events are also underrepresented in the literature. This article describes local spectator segments of the World Choir Games held in South Africa, a first for the African continent, to identify the factors that drive positive perceptions of the host as a music event tourism destination.

Various ethno-cultural practices in relation to folklore, festivals, sports, music, food, beverage, and cultural events were identified, and the tourism potentials were also measured. Data were collected by directly observing and video-recoding the ethno-cultural events, interviewing cultural leaders, religious clerics, community leaders, tourism practitioners, tourism experts, tourism workers’ organizations, entrepreneurs, and governments. With content analysis, the study has identified ethno-cultural practices with the potential to be an alternative to Lombok’s tourist attractions. These practices are not only essential for Indonesian multiculturalism but are also a resource for improving the economic quality of Sasak families and communities. The article also recommends strategies for this development. © 2022 by the authors.",cultural attractions;cultural tourism;tourism development;lombok;heritage tourism;multiculturalism;tourist attraction,Indonesia; Lesser Sunda Islands; Lombok; West Nusa Tenggara; heritage tourism; multiculturalism; tourism development; tourist attraction,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Tempat Wisata Terindah di Indonesia [The Most Beautiful Tourism Destinations in Indonesia]; Diah M., Adha R., Niawan K., Strategi Promosi Pariwisata Di Dinas Pariwisata Provinsi Nusa Tenggara Barat (Studi Kasus Promosi Pariwisata Pasca Gempa Bumi di Pulau Lombok Tahun 2018), JIAP (J.

This attention to the festival is not surprising because governments, political and religious figures, commercial interests, and tourist industries compete to define and benefit from such events worldwide. Since 1983, I have noticed a variety of changes in religious beliefs, ritual personnel and protocol, interreligious relationships, sociocultural identities, founding narratives, and performing arts over time. Once, this festival featured beliefs and performing arts that were localized, neither truly Hindu nor Islamic, and ingrained into the natural, ancestralized environment. However, the festival had to Islamize and Sasakize (that is, become more Sasak) to retain relevance among the Sasak, and had to Hinduize and Balinize to remain relevant among the Balinese. Despite these changes and increasing pressures from reformist organizations, the festival continues; in fact, it has grown in popularity and, by 2019, attracted up to 50,000 people. A tolerance of ambiguity—allowing for changing and contradictory artistic narratives, multiple ritual positions and interpretations, new positionings of interreligious relationships, and deviation from public rhetoric—has been crucial to maintain the Lingsar festival into the 21st century. © 2021 by the author.

The benefits experienced by the local community and the visitors at festivals are multi-faceted. However, existing tourism research has primarily focussed on the value of the event in terms of customer satisfaction. It has yet to explicitly identify the affect music festivals have on individuals' well-being. This study aims to investigate the effect of music festival unique attributes on visitors' satisfaction levels and how it influences individuals' well-being. Design/methodology/approach: A paper-based questionnaire was distributed to participants visiting the Miri Country Music Festival (MCMF) in Malaysia, and partial least squares–structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used for data analysis. Findings: The results from 288 respondents revealed that the festival programme was the main attribute in influencing one's satisfaction to a festival, which in turn improved one's subjective well-being. The other attributes that influence an individual's satisfaction in a music festival include food, information services and festival value. Originality/value: This study advances the body of knowledge by integrating the self-determination theory and the environmental psychology theory as the bases that a music festival potentially provides an engaging environment that is conducive for positive well-being among the participants. This is the first study that confirms the influence of the different predictors on the perceived value of MCMF, proposing a model in developing a better understanding of the participants' well-being. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",environmental psychology theory;festival experience;festival value;miri country music festival;pls-sem;self-determination theory;subjective well-being,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Akhoondnejad A., Tourist loyalty to a local cultural event: the case of Turkmen handicrafts festival, Tourism Management, 52, pp. 468-477, (2016);

The originality and relevance of the study lies in being the first investigation of a music festival where the guitar is the main instrument of the concerts. Data collection for this research was based on the completion of fieldwork with a sample of spectators who visited The Guitar Festival of Córdoba (Spain). Based on this understanding and accomplished fieldwork, this study analyzes the musical preferences linked to the different guitar genres. The results indicate that there are three typologies of spectators who are considered valid and useful in distinguishing The Guitar Festival as a cultural destination: a rocker audience, a classical audience, and a music/guitar loving audience (the most representative segment). The analysis of the festivalgoers’ musical preferences reveals that they are significantly discerning in terms of their academic level, their behavior, and the festival’s image or perceived value. The most obvious finding to emerge from this study is that knowledge on festivalgoers’ musical preferences is an essential tool for The Guitar Festival in order to make it grow as a cultural destination © 2023 Cognizant, LLC",córdoba;festival;guitar;motivation;tourism,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Akis S., Peristianis N., Warner J., Residents’ attitudes to tourism development: The case of Cyprus, Tourism Management, 17, 7, pp. 481-494, (1996); Alasuutari P., Snobismista kaikkiruokaisuuteen: Musiikkimaku ja koulutustaso, Suomalainen vapaa-aika: Arjen ilot ja valinnat, pp. 81-100, (2009); Alderson A.

I consider the effects of Iceland Airwaves on popular music in Reykjavík during the festival and outside of the festival season. My focus is primarily on how the local population experiences Iceland Airwaves and musical tourism in general. Based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Iceland between 2010 and 2018, I examine how musicians, politicians, festival management, tourism sector workers, business people, and other music industry workers approach and negotiate the rising role of popular music in Iceland's new tourism economy. This research contributes to broader understandings of how music festivals and musical tourism shape local musical life year-round, and it also offers insight into Iceland's internationally renowned popular music industry.

The findings revealed that the Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda (2014–2017) had a detailed prioritisation in these areas: creation of cultural villages, promotion of music and festival tourism, job creations, skills training and development, promotion of youth entrepreneurship and infrastructure. The GSGDA (2010–2013) examined cyber-attack in tourism, the role of municipal and district assemblies in ecotourism development and infrastructure. Finally, an Agenda for Jobs: Creating Prosperity and Equal Opportunity for All (2017–2014) covered innovation in tourism, the use of Meeting, Incentives, Conventions and Exhibition to transform the industry and create more jobs in the sector. This study extends existing tourism development literature by introducing the importance of government commitment in promoting tourism through state policies.

These festivals range from wide all-encompassing arts festivals, such as the National Arts Festival, to specific festivals that cater for very specific audiences, such as the Jazz Festival and the Philharmonic Orchestra Festival. It may therefore be expected that the attendees of the various types of festivals would differ quite substantially. While much research has been conducted to understand visitor behaviour at general arts festivals and the economic contributions of these festivals, attendees of these more specialised events have been neglected. However, understanding who the attendees are and their behaviour is paramount to the sustainability of these festivals. Therefore, this paper aims to address this void and set the following objectives: (1) to compile a profile of attendees at the Philharmonic Orchestra Festival; (2) to cluster attendees of the Festival into distinct groups; and (3) to compare the various clusters with one another. Data were obtained by administrating 500 visitor questionnaires during January 2010. Using cluster analysis, visitors are grouped based on various characteristics and the differences between the clusters are explored using factor analysis and analysis of variance. Main results indicate that most visitors are mature in age and well educated, from which three clusters were identified with differences evident between the clusters. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",classical music;cluster analysis;music festival;music tourism;south africa;art;festival;music;tourism;tourist behavior,South Africa; art; cluster analysis; festival; music; tourism; tourist behavior,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Alderson A.S., Junisbai A., Heacock I., Social status and cultural consumption in the United States, Poetics, 35, pp. 191-212, (2007); Allmendinger J., Hackman J.R., Organizations in changing environments: The case of east German symphony orchestras, Administrative Science Quarterly, 41, pp. 337-369, (1996); Arimond G., Elfessi A., A clustering method for categorical data in tourism market segmentation research, Journal of Travel Research, 39, pp. 391-397, (2001); Baerbieri C., Mahoney E., Cultural tourism behaviour and preferences among the live-performing arts audience: An application of the univorous-omnivorous framework, International Journal of Tourism Research, 12, pp. 481-496, (2010); Bailey K.D., Typologies and taxonomies: An introduction to classification techniques.Sage University Paper series on Quantitative Applications in the Social Science, (1994); Bowen H.E., Daniels M.J., Does music matter?

Past studies have examined tourist cognition, affection, and conation to festivals. Government involvement in festivals has increased during the past decade; however, few studies have examined how government policy and environment quality influence visitor loyalty to festivals. Using sample data collected from 931 visitors during spring music festivals held in Southern Taiwan, this study used a structural equation model (SEM) with latent variables to examine these influences. The results suggest that government policy positively influences perceived environment quality, visitor satisfaction, and loyalty to festivals. Furthermore, the results from a multigroup SEM approach reveal that tourists' revisit reason (revisit festival versus other) and occupation type (student versus nonstudent) moderate the relationships between government policy and festival loyalty. Implications on festival planning and government policymaking are discussed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",festival loyalty;government policy;moderating effect;music festival;structural equation modeling (sem);festival;music;tourism economics;tourist attraction;tourist behavior,Taiwan;

The studies that have been conducted on these extended youth parties have focused primarily on specific risk-taking behaviors, such as drug use and violence. Here, we scrutinize the research on extended youth parties to identify general changes that young people undergo at these events. We call these celebrations departies, because they center on the organization and facilitation of momentary departures from the participants’ everyday life. Participants depart (1) spatially, by traveling to locations that are constructed as sites of opportunity and excess; (2) temporally, by partying for several days in a row and focusing on immediate gratifications; (3) morally, by engaging in activities that are widely deemed immoral; (4) stylistically, by altering their stylistic expressions through dress, demeanor, and consumption; and (5) experientially, because the parties generate mood and mind alterations. These are overlapping and intertwined elements, the combination of which amounts to a distinct type of youth party. Departies constitute exceptional events in the lives of many young people, and ought to be studied from a comparative perspective. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",alcohol;drugs;nightlife;risk;tourism;youth,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Andrews H., Tits Out for the Boys and No Back Chat”: Gendered Space on Holiday, Space and Culture, 12, 2, pp. 166-182, (2009); Andriotis K., Brits Behaving Badly: Template Analysis of Newspaper Content, International Journal of Tourism Anthropology, 1, 1, pp. 15-34, (2010); Apostolopoulos Y., Sonmez S., Yu C.H., HIV-Risk Behaviours of American Spring Break Vacationers: A Case of Situational Disinhibition?, International Journal of STD & AIDS, 13, 11, pp. 733-743, (2002); Bataille G., Eroticism, (2001); Bell D., Destination Drinking: Toward a Research Agenda on Alcotourism, Drugs-Education Prevention and Policy, 15, 3, pp. 291-304, (2008); Bellis M.A., Hale G., Bennett A., Chaudry M., Kilfoyle M., Ibiza Uncovered: Changes in Substance Use and Sexual Behaviour Amongst Young People Visiting an International Night-Life Resort, International Journal of Drug Policy, 11, 3, pp. 235-244, (2000); Bellis M.A., Hughes K., Bennett A., Thomson R., The Role of an International Nightlife Resort in the Proliferation of Recreational Drugs, Addiction, 98, 12, pp. 1713-1721, (2003); Bellis M.A., Hughes K., Calafat A., Juan M., Schnitzer S., Relative Contributions of Holiday Location and Nationality to Changes in Recreational Drug Taking Behaviour: A Natural Experiment in the Balearic Islands, European Addiction Research, 15, 2, pp. 78-86, (2009); Bellis M.A., Hughes K., Thomson R., Bennett A., Sexual Behaviour of Young People in International Tourist Resorts, Sexually Transmitted Infections, 80, pp. 43-47, (2004); Bey H., T.A.Z.: The Temporary Autonomous Zone, Ontological Anarchy, Poetic Terrorism, (1991); Bhardwa B., (2014); Briggs D., A Phenomenological Account of Deviance and Risk on Holiday: British Youth and the Consumer Experience in Ibiza, New Directions in Crime and Deviance, pp. 127-144, (2012); Briggs D., Deviance and Risk on Holiday: An Ethnography of British Tourists in Ibiza, (2013); Briggs D., Turner T., Understanding British Youth Behaviors on Holiday in Ibiza, International Journal of Culture, Tourism and Hospitality Research, 6, 1, pp. 81-90, (2012); Briggs D., Turner T., David K., De Courcey T., British Youth Abroad: Some Observations on the Social Context of Binge Drinking in Ibiza, Drugs and Alcohol Today, 11, 1, pp. 26-35, (2011); Bohling F., Alcoholic Assemblages: Exploring Fluid Subjects in the Night-Time Economy, Geoforum, 58, pp. 132-142, (2015); Brown L., Stephan Y.S., Anonymous and Uninhibited: Sexual Encounters During the International Sojourn, Journal of Tourism and Cultural Change, 11, 1-2, pp. 35-47, (2013); Calafat A., Blay N., Bellis M., Hughes K., Kokkevi A., Mendes F., Cibin B., Et al., Tourism, Nightlife and Violence: A Cross Cultural Analysis and Preventive Recommendations, European Commission.

In an attempt to identify predictors of festival consumption, this study focuses on the influence of the cultural capital of music festival visitors. Based on a survey of visitors to a classic music festival in Korea, this article analyzes the divergent effects on festival expenditures of four different forms of cultural capital: embodied, objectified, institutionalized, and familial capital. The empirical research shows that institutionalized and familial cultural capital have a positive and significant effect on the expenditures of festival visitors while embodied and objectified capital do not. The research findings suggest that cultural taste aspect of cultural capital may explain festival participation but economic resource aspect of capital is more deeply related to the amount of consumption at festivals. © 2017 Cognizant, LLC.",classical music;cultural capital;festival;tourism expenditure,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Andersson T., Getz D., Resource dependency, costs and revenues of a street festival, Tourism Economics, 13, 1, pp. 143-162, (2007);

It considers “sustainable” music festivals as conceptually different––although quite akin––to “green” cultural events, because sustainability should mean much more than merely embedding “green” or “eco-friendly” practices into the festival management. The paper provides an initial attempt to: (i) review literature on sustainable festival practice; (ii) locate sustainable performing arts festivals around the world; (iii) elicit the way in which sustainability is interpreted in that context, and;(iv) establish an ideological critique of the “sustainable” festival phenomenon.

Specifically, it explores meanings and struggles of tourism festival making that connects individual subjectivities and politics of culture production. As such, it offers a broad conceptual framework merging the Lacanian gaze into tourism research and MacCannell's theory. The findings reveal that festival producers are constantly dealing with various contested roles and voices, revealing in-depth psychological complexities situated within managerial experiences. Meanwhile, the process of festival management must be seen as significantly influenced by the mechanism of cultural offering that the producers attempt to assert and define through the festival space. Finally, implications related to the greater realms of psychoanalytic insights and their potential connections with tourism management are discussed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",gaze;lacan;metal music;tourism festivals;festival;music;theory;tourism;tourism management,conceptual framework; festival; music; theory; tourism; tourism management,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Besculides A., Lee M.E., McCormick P.J., Residents' perceptions of the cultural benefits of tourism, Annals of Tourism Research, 29, 2, pp. 303-319, (2002); Briggs C., Learning how to ask: A sociolinguistic appraisal of the role of the interview in social science, (1986); Brohman J., New directions in tourism for third world development, Annals of Tourism Research, 23, 1, pp. 48-70, (1996); Buda D.M., The death drive in tourism studies, Annals of Tourism Research, 50, pp. 39-51, (2015); Buda D.M., McIntosh A.J., Dark tourism and voyeurism: Tourist arrested for “spying” in Iran, International Journal of Culture, Tourism and Hospitality Research, 7, 3, pp. 214-226, (2013); Cheong S.M., Miller M.L., Power and tourism: A foucaultian observation, Annals of Tourism Research, 27, 2, pp. 371-390, (2000); Chodorow N.J., The reproduction of mothering: Psychoanalysis and the sociology of gender, (1999); Crang M., Picturing practices: Research through the tourist gaze, Progress in Human Geography, 21, 3, pp. 359-373, (1997); Creswell J.W., Miller D.L., Determining validity in qualitative inquiry, Theory Into Practice, 39, 3, pp. 124-130, (2000); Crompton J.L., McKay S.L., Motives of visitors attending festival events, Annals of Tourism Research, 24, 2, pp. 425-439, (1997); Dale P., It was easy, it was cheap, so what?

The Sinj Tourist Board launched an unprecedented campaign in organizing and advertising the various events – ranging from historical re-enactments, film and music productions, folkloristic performances, sports events, exhibitions, and fashion shows, to religious processions and conferences. Using a variety of media formats, these efforts were aimed at creating a new national epic, expanding the meaning of the miraculous battle of 1715 from a local narrative to a nation-wide symbol, representing Croatia in a European and global context. This article focuses on various theatrical re-enactments of the historic battle and the alleged Marian apparition, assessing the role of nostalgia and authenticity in contemporary living history performances. While one of the underlying motifs in the case of Sinj is to enhance the region’s attraction as a tourist destination, the article also theorizes the re-enactment’s epistemological and political claims by proposing that these interactive engagements with history take an active stance in promoting and/or re-inventing heroic olden times to advance socio-political conditions in the present (Gegenwartsbewältigung). © 2017 Association for the Study of Nationalities.",croatia;cultural heritage;memory of violence;nostalgia;post-war identity;postsocialism;re-enactment;religious symbolism;tourism;tourist attraction;tourist destination,Croatia; Dalmatia; Sinj; cultural heritage; mass media; memory; Ottoman empire; post-war; symbolism; tourism; tourist attraction; tourist destination; violence,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Agnew V., Introduction: What Is Reenactment?, Criticism, 46, 3, pp. 327-339, (2004); Baker C., Sounds of the Borderland, Popular Music, War and Nationalism in Croatia since 1991, (2010); Ballinger P., Authentic Hybrids’ in the Balkan Borderlands, Current Anthropology, 45, 1, pp. 31-60, (2004); Bjelic D.I., Savic O., Balkan as a Metaphor. between Globalization and Fragmentation, (2005); Caleta J., Klapa Singing, a Traditional Folk Phenomenon of Dalmatia, Narodna Umjetnost: Croatian Journal of Ethnology and Folklore Research, 34, 1, pp. 127-145, (1997); Hajdarpasic E., Whose Bosnia?

In this way, the research needed on the individual behavioural and psychological factors of the events-tourism sector are addressed. Design/methodology/approach: Planned events in this case the three largest arts festivals in South Africa (SA) (in Potchefstroom – Festival A, Grahamstown – Festival B and Oudtshoorn – Festival C) were studied. Five different attributes – festival brands, ticket prices, entertainment activities, food and beverages and transport to venues – were developed to describe arts festivals. The data were analysed using CA. CA was used in a linear regression model with individual ratings for each arts festival product. In addition, two techniques often used as complementary to and in conjunction with CA, namely, cluster and correspondence analysis were also used. K-means clustering constructed a four-factor solution, which categorised and labelled the attributes as, brand-, price-, activity- and transport-sensitive. The software package STATISTICA used the results for the correspondence analysis to draw maps between the arts festivals and attribute importance, age groups and festival attributes, arts festivals and language. Findings: Festival A and B preferred the attribute level quality music, whilst Festival C preferred quality performances on the attribute entertainment. On the attribute refreshments, Festivals B and C preferred value for money and Festival A, a wide variety of good quality refreshments. On the attributes transport and ticket prices, all three festivals agreed for safe and secure parking and at the same price. Research limitations/implications: This paper demonstrates, by applying the recommended tool, how it can be used to distinguish festivals/events in an overcrowded SA market with the possibility of providing a competitive advantage. In that all three festivals researched preferred the attribute festival brand held in the region which destination marketing organisations (DMOs) can use to their advantage. Practical implications: This paper demonstrates, by applying the recommended tool, how it can be used to distinguish festivals/events in an overcrowded SA market with the possibility of providing a competitive advantage. In that all three festivals researched preferred the attribute festival brand held in the region which DMOs can use to their advantage. Originality/value: The description of the development of the model could illustrate how market positioning (by way of revitalizing older theories), in the arts festival context can be approached to ensure an optimal arts festival offering. By so doing the paper strives to make an academic contribution. © 2017, International Tourism Studies Association.",cluster and correspondence analysis;conjoint analysis tool;dmos;event and festival tourism;positioning model,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Aaker D.A., Shansby J.G., Positioning your product, (1982);

A survey was conducted at the concert where a total of 600 questionnaires were administered, and 585 completed questionnaires were included in the analysis. Independent t tests, two-way frequency tables, and chi-square tests were used to profile the attendees and to investigate any significant differences between male and female visitors, based on demographics, behavioral variables, and motivational factors. The results show clear differences between male and female visitors, which are significant enough to regard them as two separate market segments. These differences should be taken into consideration when marketing and managing major music events. © 2015 Cognizant Comm.

This is achieved through two objectives: first, by revealing the complexities and philosophical depths of DP; second, by providing a practical, stepped method that offers rigour and transparency. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based upon a study that explored the lived experience of the popular music festival-goer. It generally discusses the phenomenological philosophies of Husserl (1965 [1911]) and the descriptive phenomenological method in psychology of Giorgi (2009). It identifies not only some of the challenges and criticisms of DP but also the strengths of using a scientific approach to phenomenological research. Findings: The philosophical strengths underlying DP afford a deeper understanding of the phenomenon being studied. The lived experience music festival study illustrates that the method of data collection and analysis highlights the intricacy of the philosophical debate and research findings. Although the bracketing, or epoché, method of DP has been criticised, the actual application is far more complex than trying to blank out prior knowledge. The aim is to ensure that it is the participants’ experiences that are used to identify the structure that is the phenomenon rather than the personal interpretation of the researcher. Originality/value: It is recognised that researching the lifeworld affords a greater depth of understanding of experiences in people’s lives. One of the disappointments has been that one branch of phenomenological research, DP, has been underutilised and at times misunderstood in hospitality, tourism and event research. This paper aims to demonstrate and illustrate why and how DP should be considered in the future research of such experiences. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",descriptive phenomenology;event;experience;festival;giorgi;husserl;lived-world;meaning;methodology;phenomenology;philosophy,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Applebaum M., Phenomenological psychological research as science, Journal of Phenomenological Psychology, 43, 1, pp. 36-72, (2012); Broome R.E., The lived-Experience of leading a successful police vehicle pursuit: a descriptive phenomenological psychological inquiry, Journal of Phenomenological Psychology, 44, 2, pp. 220-243, (2013); Christensen M., Welch A., Barr J., Husserlian descriptive phenomenology: a review of intentionality, reduction and the natural attitude, Journal of Nursing Education and Practice, 7, 8, pp. 113-118, (2017); Cohen E., A phenomenology of tourism experiences, Sociology, 13, 2, pp. 179-201, (1979); Dahlberg K., Dahlberg H., Nystrom M., Reflective Lifeworld Research, (2008); Finlay L., Introducing phenomenological research, (2008); Finlay L., Debating phenomenological research methods, Phenomenology and Practice, 3, 1, pp. 6-25, (2009); Follesdal D., Noema and meaning in Husserl, Phenomenology and Philosophical Research, 50, pp. 263-271, (1990); Giorgi A., A phenomenological perspective on certain qualitative research methods, Journal of Phenomenological Psychology, 25, 2, pp. 190-220, (1994); Giorgi A., Concerning a serious misunderstanding of the essence of the phenomenological method in psychology, Journal of Phenomenological Psychology, 39, 1, pp. 33-58, (2008); Giorgi A., The Descriptive Phenomenological Method in Psychology.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper opted for a two-stage analysis. An explorative study has been carried out to identify producers with this offering and assess their main characteristics. A direct survey has been carried out to acquire detailed information about the profile of the enterprises as well as to assess motivations, results achieved and satisfaction concerning the experience offered. Findings: Food can be alternatively the main subject (e.g. food museums) or be combined with other cultural expression (e.g. music festivals inside wineries), and the choice appears to mainly depend on personal interest of entrepreneurs. The production of the food tourism experience not only increases the tourist attractiveness but also generates other benefits, such as improving brand visibility and relationship with local stakeholders. Research limitations/implications: Because of the sample chosen, the research results may lack generalizability. Furthermore, it may be important to deeply investigate some issues that remain partly unanswered. Practical implications: The paper sheds lights on characteristics of tourism experiences combining food and culture and hopefully aims at increasing awareness among producers about their current attractiveness.

The city's response was to crack down on electronic music, arguing the scene posed a unique danger to the safety of the city and that electronic music was not part of Playa's cultural identity. Those in the scene argued something else was underway, suggesting that the scene was being pushed out of the city to make room for higher end, luxury tourism development. The ousting of electronic music from the city raised important questions about the city's cultural identity and the direction of tourism development the city would take. This essay takes a critical look at these events, tracing the way Playa's particular electronic music scene grew to global notoriety as both a cause and consequence of the Maya Riviera's impressive tourism expansion over the last two decades and how those in the scene believed themselves to be an essential part of the city's heritage. The city government's decision to oust BPM reveals how struggles over cultural heritage are at the very heart of how urban space is organized in tourism zones. Using the concept of ""contestation"", this ethnographic account demonstrates how disputes over heritage and culture frame important questions of neoliberal, political-economy and can lead to counterintuitive outcomes. © 2019 by the authors.",contestation;cultural heritage;electronic music;maya riviera;neoliberalism,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"(2001); Arriola E.R., Accountability for Murder in the Maquiladoras: Linking Corporate Indifference to Gender Violence at the US-Mexico Border, Seattle Journal for Social Justice, 5, pp. 603-659, (2006); Borneman J., Senders S., Politics without a Head: Is the ""Love Parade"" a New Form of Political Identification?, Cultural Anthropology, 15, pp. 217-294, (2000); Castaneda Q., In the Museum of Maya Culture: Touring Chichén Itzá, (1996); Bianet C.M., A Return to Servitude: Maya Migration and The Tourist Trade in Cancún, (2010); Che D., Music and Entrepreneurship in Post-Fordist Detroit, In Sound, Society, and the Geography of Popular Music, pp. 261-280, (2009); Cornet C., Tourism development and Resistance in China, Annals of Tourism Research, 52, pp. 29-43, (2015); D'Andrea A., Global Nomads Techno and New Age as Transnational Countercultures in Ibiza and Goa, In Rave Culture and Religion, pp. 236-253, (2004); Dinzey-Flores Z.Z., Spatially Polarized Landscapes and a New Approach to Urban Inequality, Latin American Research Review, 52, pp. 241-252, (2017); Emerson M.O., Smiley K.T., Market Cities, People Cities: The Shape of Our Urban Future, (2018); Geertz C., The Interpretation of Cultures, (1973); Gill L., Kasmir S., History, Politics, Space, Labor: On Unevenness as an Anthropological Concept, Dialectical Anthropology, 40, pp. 87-102, (2016); Goldstein D., The Spectacular City: Violence and Performance in Urban Bolivia, (2004); Gomez Leyva C., Aparece Narcomanta en Playa del Carmen, se Adjudicarían Balacera en Antro, (2017); Graeber D., Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of Our Own Dreams, (2001); Graham B., Heritage as knowledge: Capital or culture?, Urban Studies, 39, pp. 1003-1017, (2002); Greenhouse C.J., Introduction, In Ethnographies of Neoliberalism, (2010); Gregory S., The Devil Behind the Mirror: Globalization and Politics in the Dominican Republic, (2007); Guardado G.M., Turismo, Globalización y Mercantilización del Espacio y la Cultura en la Riviera Maya: Un Acercamiento a Tres Escenarios, In Etnia, Lengua y Territorio.

Because of this, studies on performing arts have been actively conducted in the arts management and marketing fields. Yet, little research has examined the benefits of the performing arts from a tourism perspective. Thus, the current study employed conjoint analysis in an attempt to identify the most preferred performing arts tourism products as perceived by Japanese tourists. Results revealed the most important determinant attributes Japanese tourists consider in purchasing a Korean performing arts product were ‘admission price’, followed by ‘type of theater’, ‘genre’, and ‘location of theater’. The most preferred performing arts tourism product was found to be the following: 5.517 (overall utility) = 1.081 (Korean pop music concert) + 2.233 (less than 5000 Yen) + 0.775 (downtown Seoul) + 1.428 (exclusive theater). © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",conjoint analysis;japanese;performing arts;product,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Agrusa J., Kim S., Understanding preferences of Japanese tourists to Hawaii, Tourism Analysis, 13, 5-6, pp. 485-497, (2008); Barbieri C., Mahoney E., Cultural tourism behaviour and preferences among the live-performing arts audience: an application of the univorous–omnivorous framework, International Journal of Tourism Research, 12, pp. 481-496, (2010); Bogue J., Sorenson D., O' Keeffe M., Cross-category innovativeness as a source of new product ideas: consumers’ perceptions of over-the-counter pharmacological beverages, Food Quality and Preference, 20, pp. 363-371, (2009); Britton S., Tourism, capital and place: towards a critical geography of tourism, Society and Space, 9, pp. 461-478, (1991); Brooker E., Joppe M., Entrepreneurial approaches to rural tourism in the Netherlands: distinct differences, Tourism Planning and Development, 11, 3, pp. 343-353, (2014); Cetin G., Bilgihan A., Components of cultural tourists’ experiences in destinations, Current Issues in Tourism, 19, 2, pp. 137-154, (2016); Chacko H., Schaffer J., The evolution of a festival, Tourism Management, 14, pp. 475-482, (1993); Choi M., Hallyu idol stars in Japan, (2016); Crawford M., Benedetto D.A., New Products Management, (2008); Crouch G.I., Destination competitiveness: an analysis of determinant attributes, Journal of Travel Research, 50, 1, pp. 27-45, (2011); Dellaert B., Borgers A., Timmermans H., A day in the city: using conjoint choice experiments to model urban tourists’ choice of activity packages, Tourism Management, 16, 5, pp. 347-353, (1995); Dolnicar S., Beyond “commonsense segmentation”: a systematics of segmentation approaches in tourism, Journal of Travel Research, 42, 3, pp. 244-250, (2004); Getz D., Festivals, Special Events and Tourism, (1991); Grant D., Paliwoda S., Segmenting Alberta arts and festivals consumers, Festival Management and Event Tourism, 5, pp. 207-220, (1998); Green P.E., Srinivasan V., Conjoint analysis in consumer research: issues and outlook, Journal of Consumer Research, 5, 2, pp. 103-123, (1978); Green P.E., Srinivasan V., Conjoint analysis in marketing: new developments with implications for research and practice, Journal of Marketing, 54, 4, pp. 3-19, (1990); Guetzkow J., How the Arts Impact Communities: An Introduction to the Literature on Arts Impact Studies, (2002); Fillis I., Lee B., Internationalization of Korean performing arts, European Journal of Marketing, 45, 5, pp. 822-846, (2011); Hair J.F., Black W.C., Babin B.J., Et al., Multivariate Data Analysis, (2006); Hargrove C.M., Heritage tourism, Cultural Resource Management, 1, pp. 10-11, (2002); Hu C., Hiemstra S.J., Hybrid conjoint analysis as a research technique to measure meeting planners’ preferences in hotel selection, Journal of Travel Research, 35, 2, pp. 62-69, (1996); Hughes H., Arts, Entertainment, and Tourism, (2000); Hume M., Mort G.S., Satisfaction in performing arts: the role of value?, European Journal of Marketing, 42, 3-4, pp. 311-326, (2008); Hume M., Mort G.S., Liesch P., Et al., Understanding service experience in non-profit performing arts: implications for operations and service management, Journal of Operations Management, 24, pp. 304-324, (2006); Hume M., Mort G.S., Winzar H., Exploring repurchase intention in a performing arts context: who comes?

This approach has failed to generate a generalizable set of motivation items. In addition, there is increasing criticism in the literature of the common methodological framework used in festival motivation studies, due to a perceived over-reliance on motivations derived from the broader tourism and travel research, with too little attention to event-specific factors. The purpose of this paper is to address these issues by analyzing a sub-category of motivation studies, music festivals, in order to see if this approach can elicit a consistent set of motivation dimensions for the sub-category, which can in turn be compared and contrasted with the broader literature. A new case study of motivations to attend the 28th Macau International Music Festival (MIMF) is included to complement the existing music festival sub-category by adding a classical music and music festivals in Asia. Design/methodology/approach: Motivation dimensions important to music festivals are compared to dimensions across the broader festival motivation literature to find similarities and differences. Factor analysis is used to identify the motivation dimensions of attendees at the MIMF and the results are compared to those of existing music festival studies. Findings: Music festival goers are shown to be primarily motivated by the core festival offering, the music, in contrast to festival attendees in general, where socialization has emerged as the primary motivating element.

The musicâ€™s cultural terrain has been extensively mapped in the first decade of this century. In this article, we examine the phenomenon of the Whitby Goth Weekend, a modern Goth music festival, which has contributed to (and has been altered by) the heritage-tourism marketing of Whitby as the holiday resort of Dracula (the place where Bram Stoker imagined the Vampire Count arriving one dark and stormy night). We examine marketing literature and websites that sell Whitby as a spooky town, and suggest that this strategy has driven the success of the Goth festival. We explore the development of the festival and the politics of its ownership, and its increasing visibility as a mainstream tourist destination for those who want to dress up for the weekend. By interviewing Goths from the north of England, we suggest that the mainstreaming of the festival has led to it becoming less attractive to those more established, older Goths who see the subcultureâ€™s authenticity as being rooted in the post-punk era, and who believe that Goth subculture should be something one lives full-time. © 2013, SAGE Publications.

These benefits are integrated into a single estimate using the contingent valuation method. In the study, a sample of 524 Koronadal households was asked for their willingness to pay (WTP) or contribute to natural resources and cultural heritage conservation efforts in Lake Sebu in the form of a lump-sum monthly amount collected together with their electricity bill payment. The mean WTP per month is estimated to be Php 52.42 (USD 1.04) using the probit regression estimates (parametric mean) and Php 64.39 (USD 1.27) using the Turnbull formula (non-parametric mean), both less than 1% (0.26–0.33%) of average monthly household income. Multiplying the annualized WTP by the number of households in Koronadal, total potential annual contributions from Koronadal City would range from Php 29.2–35.7M, about 3% of the City Government’s 2019 total revenues of Php 932.6M (Koronadal City Government Budget Office). Even just a fraction of this potential collection can support essential conservation efforts in Lake Sebu, which – up to the present – have been inadequate due to financial constraints. Moreover, the results of the regression analysis reveal that households are more likely to support the conservation program if the amount of required contribution is smaller and household income is higher. Older and more educated respondents are, likewise, more likely to support the program. © 2020, Department of Science and Technology.

How a festival is perceived, interpreted and understood is an essential part of public response and attitudes toward the phenomena. Understanding dynamic and diverse host perceptions and attitudes toward the festival impacts can help planners ensure the effectiveness of the event planning and management. The study aims to monitor host perceptions of impacts of Beijing Strawberry Music Festival in time and space using longitudinal and comparative data. The findings suggest that there are both significant changes and consistencies in positive and negative perceptions of the music festival impacts over time; findings also suggest that residents from three distant zones share similar perceptions of the impacts over time in a local-wide area. The study offers a holistic insight into tourism impact research, and has practical implications for event management and planning. © 2017 Asia Pacific Tourism Association.",event management;host perceptions;longitudinal effects;music festival;spatial effects;tourism impacts;tourism marketing;china;festival;music;perception;tourism market,Beijing [China]; China; Fragaria x ananassa; festival; music; perception; spatial analysis; tourism market,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Andereck K.L., Valentine K.M., Knopf R.C., Vogt C.A., Residents’ perceptions of community tourism impacts, Annals of Tourism Research, 32, 4, pp. 1056-1076, (2005); Andersson T.D., Lundberg E., Commensurability and sustainability: Triple impact assessments of a tourism event, Tourism Management, 37, 3, pp. 99-109, (2013); Ap J., Resident perceptions on tourism impacts, Annals of Tourism Research, 19, 4, pp. 665-690, (1992); Ap J., Crompton J.L., Developing and testing a tourism impact scale, Journal of Travel Research, 37, 2, pp. 120-131, (1998); Belisle F.J., Hoy D.R., The perceived impact of tourism by residents: A case study in Santa Marta, Annals of Tourism Research, 7, 1, pp. 83-101, (1980); Bracalente B., Chirieleison C., Cossignani M., Ferrucci L., Gigliotti M., Ranalli M.G., The economic impact of cultural events: The Umbria Jazz music festival, Tourism Economics, 17, 6, pp. 1235-1255, (2011); Butler R.W., The concept of a tourist area cycle of evolution: Implications for management of resources, Canadian Geographer, 24, 1, pp. 5-12, (1980); Chen F., Tian L., Comparative study on residents’ perceptions of follow-up impacts of the 2008 Olympics, Tourism Management, 51, pp. 263-281, (2015); Daniels M.J., Central place theory and sport tourism impacts, Annals of Tourism Research, 34, 2, pp. 332-347, (2007); Davis A., Experiential places or places of experience?

The charac-teristic of gambus that are played solely and has an original tuning system. A gambus tunggal style produces a melodic tone, accompanied by chanted poems that involve new romantic romance of Lampung, or parents’ advice to their children. This ethnography study aims to comprehend how the gambus tunggal artists maintain the existence in Lampung. The study applies a descriptive method with a qualitative idea. We have interrogated and field studies to gather primary data. A purposive sampling technique was used to interview a gambus tunggal player who existed for decades. The result indicates that a gambus tunggal artist is doing a collaborative struggle to support gambus tunggal and living sources’ survival. They need collaboration to keep the existence of traditional Lampung music. Gambus players have considered using social media as a promo-tional strategy. The local government’s role has a tremendous impact, for example, providing an opportunity to perform gambus tunggal at various events, festivals, and many competitions. Therefore, the tourism sector is the foundation of Lampung’s traditional music. It establishes policies to serve various performing arts. © 2020, Universitas Negeri Semarang.

The Peace & Love music festival was the hallmark event of the Swedish city Borlänge. In 2013, the event organization declared bankruptcy and canceled the forthcoming festival. The purpose of this paper is to identify and discuss the factors that caused the failure of the 2013 Peace & Love festival. Design/methodology/approach: The case of the Peace & Love festival is analyzed using three data sources: interviews with the former members of the event organization; secondary data describing the Swedish festival industry; and festival visitors’ perspectives represented by comments on social media. An organizational ecology perspective frames the analysis. Findings: The results of the study reveal that the failure of the event can be understood by a combination of three components: an organization in a vulnerable position, a strong new competitor entering the Swedish festival market, and uncertain visitors searching for the new place to be. Originality/value: Very few studies have researched event failure, although the subject is a recommended priority within the field of festival studies. This study presents a thorough examination of a hallmark event failure, which contributes to this area of knowledge and provides relevant information for organizations and host cities. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",event failure;festival industry;festival organization;festival visitors’ behavior;hallmark event;organizational ecology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Andersson T., Getz D., Tourism as a mixed industry, Tourism Management, 30, 6, pp. 847-856, (2009); Andersson T., Getz D., Mykletun R., Sustainable festival populations: an application of organizational ecology, Tourism Analysis, 18, 6, pp. 621-634, (2013); Butler R., The concept of a tourist area cycle of evolution: implications for management of resources, Canadian Geographer, 24, 1, pp. 5-12, (1980); Carlsen J., Andersson T., Ali-Knight J., Jaeger K., Taylor R., Festival management innovation and failure, International Journal of Event and Festival Management, 1, 2, pp. 120-131, (2010); Carroll G., Hannan M., The Demography of Corporations and Industries, (2000); Creswell J.W., Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design – Choosing among Five Approaches, (2007); Einarsen K., Mykletun R.J., Exploring the success of the Gladmat festival (The Stavanger food festival), Scandinavian Journal of Hospitality and Tourism, 9, 3, pp. 225-248, (2009); Frost W., Laing J., Avoiding burnout: the succession planning, governance and resourcing of rural tourism festivals, Journal of Sustainable Tourism, 23, 8-9, pp. 1298-1317, (2015); Getz D., Why festivals fail, Event Management, 7, 4, pp. 209-219, (2002); Getz D., Andersson T., Sustainable festivals: on becoming an institution, Event Management, 12, 1, pp. 1-17, (2008); Getz D., Andersson T., Analyzing whole populations of festivals and events: an application of organizational ecology, Journal of Policy Research in Tourism, Leisure and Events, 8, 3, pp. 249-273, (2016); Getz D., Page S.J., Progress and prospects for event tourism research, Tourism Management, 52, pp. 593-631, (2015); Getz D., Svensson B., Pettersson R., Gunnervall A., Hallmark events: definition, goals and planning process, International Journal of Event Management Research, 7, 1-2, pp. 47-67, (2012); Hannan M., Rethinking age dependence in organizational mortality: logical formalizations, American Journal of Sociology, 104, 1, pp. 126-164, (1998); Hannan M., Freeman J., The population ecology of organizations, American Journal of Sociology, 82, 5, pp. 929-964, (1977); Hannan M., Freeman J., Structural inertia and organizational change, American Sociological Review, 49, 2, pp. 149-164, (1984); Hannan M., Freeman J., Organizational Ecology, (1989); Hannan M., Polos L., Carroll G., Logics of Organization Theory: Audiences, Code, and Ecologies, (2007); Heldt T., Klerby A., Peace & Love 2010: Värderade och icke-värderade ekonomiska effekter, (2011); Heldt T., Olofsson M., Peace & Love 2011: Uppskattning av festivalens ekonomiska betydelse via segmenteringsansatsen, (2011); Johansson D., Music festivals in Sweden – an analysis of the ten largest commercial festivals 2000-2013, (2013); Kennelly M., Moyle B., Lamont M., Service recovery and leisure events: Implications from the cancellation of Ironman® New Zealand 2012, Annals of Leisure Research, 18, 1, pp. 48-64, (2015); Kinnunen M., Haahti A., Visitor discourses on experiences: reasons for festival success and failure, International Journal of Event and Festival Management, 6, 3, pp. 251-268, (2015); Kozinets R.V., Netnography: Doing Ethnographic Research Online, (2010); Krippendorff K., Content Analysis.

Although some processional aspects of innovation have been examined in detail, the process of implementation of innovation at an organisational level has been neglected, especially in the tourism literature. This paper adopts a relational perspective to examine the implementation of innovation within the burgeoning Chinese modern music festivals sector. The findings of six detailed case studies show how identity, equality, guanxi, and a range of specific contextual factors, influence the development of relationships. These, in turn, affect innovation implementation, notably by influencing the acquisition and use of knowledge and other resources essential to the process. A conceptual model is proposed which explains the complexities of these relationships, their roles in innovation implementation, and incorporates mediating factors such as temporality, organisational structure, and the reliance upon volunteers found within events. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",events;guanxi;innovation;social exchange;china;festival;knowledge;music;tourism management,China; festival; innovation; knowledge; music; social network; tourism management,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Alston J.P., Wa, guanxi, and Inhwa: Managerial principles in Japan, China, and korea, Business Horizons, 32, 2, pp. 26-31, (1989); Axtell C.M., Holman D.J., Unsworth K.L., Wall T.D., Waterson P.E., Harrington E., Shopfloor Innovation: Facilitating the suggestion and implementation of ideas, Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 73, pp. 265-285, (2000); Benedict R., Patterns of culture, (1935); Bornay-Barrachina M., Lopez-Cabrales A., Valle-Cabrera R., How do employment relationships enhance firm Innovation?

Experiences differ from all other economic offerings by being inherently embodied and personalised and the experiences that can attach the most value will be those that are the most engaging and transformative. The experiential and transformational nature of tourism, and particularly island tourism, leads it to be a potential growth sector within an Experience Economy. This article explores how islanders within the Outer Hebrides of Scotland are (co-)creating engaging experiences through music performances in the form of festivals, ceilidhs, and bar sessions to increase tourism spend. This bottom-up approach to socio-economic development is novel in this context as musical performances in the Outer Hebrides have long been tied to the Gaelic language and culture. However, until recently they have not been considered a consumable economic offering. This article explores how using the lens of the Experience Economy offers new insights for islanders to generate tourism spend on their own terms.",archipelago;experience economy;music;outer hebrides;tourism,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Baerenholdt J.O., Haldrup M., Larsen J., Urry J., Performing tourist places, (2004); Baldacchino G., Jurisdictional self-reliance for small island territories: considering the partition of Cyprus, The Round Table, 91, 365, pp. 349-360, (2002); Baldacchino G., Extreme tourism: Lessons from the world's cold water islands, (2006); Baldacchino G., Warm versus cold water island tourism: a review of policy implications, Island Studies Journal, 1, 2, pp. 183-200, (2006); Baldacchino G., The Lure of the island: A spatial analysis of power relations, Journal of Marine and Island Cultures, 1, 2, pp. 55-63, (2012); Baldacchino G., Bertram G., The beak of the finch: Insights into the economic development of small economies, The Round Table, 98, 401, pp. 141-160, (2009); Baum T., The fascination of islands: a tourist perspective.

The research employs a multi-site data collection approach undertaking field observations and 68 in-depth semi-structured interviews at seven music festivals across three years. The study contributes to the theoretical development of a liminality framework by providing empirical evidence of the nature of liminality. It extends our understanding of event tourist experiences by highlighting the development and role of three types of communitas and identifying six stages within a rite of passage. The resulting multifaceted coexistence of liminal behaviours and identity with everyday routine life provides a new approach to the critical understanding of the role of liminality. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd,china;communitas;liminality;music festival;rite of passage;music,China;

Theoretical determinants are based on a multi-disciplinary approach to studying the research subject and build upon the recent literature. To analyse the current state and actively create the future of the audio offering and promotion of Krk Island, applied research was conducted based on a survey of stakeholders and destination managers, a study of the acoustic quality of a music concert and the proposals of the authors based on the scientific literature. An audio management model that incorporates the valorisation of sound and music within a soundscape approach, as well business operations within the framework of a tourism product club as a new collaborative way of doing business, is put forward to facilitate the development of audio products aimed at ensuring a one-of-a-kind tourist experience as well as profit multiplication. © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",acoustic design;acoustic quality;audio management;branding;development;development concept;innovation;krk island;music;soundscape;tourism policy;tourism product club;croatia;tourism management;tourist destination,Croatia;

While sharing these goals with other leisure activities, the festivals also aim for the actualization of encountering unknown or alien destinations. This journey is enabled by the media ecology of the festival, which notably includes the effects of psychedelic drugs. Drawing on ethnographic research of Melbourne-based festivals, this article explores the cultural meanings of getting “trashed” or “wasted” on psychedelic drugs within the outdoor festival environment. The partygoers' temporary retreat into nature ties into the theme of an exile that traces back to the 1960s and still pervades psychedelic culture. This article reworks this theme by addressing the ironic reconfiguration of nature at psytrance festivals, where excessive media consumption leads to an authentic way to connect our urban cultures with nature in its contemporary unauthenticity. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",festival;nature-based recreation;psychedelic drug;psytrance;waste;cultural influence;music;tourist behavior;tourist destination,Australia; Melbourne; Victoria [Australia]; cultural influence; drug; festival; leisure industry; music; recreational activity; tourist behavior; tourist destination,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Rebirth, (2007); Ukalen, (2009); Bakhtin M.M., Rabelais and his world, (1968); Baudrillard J., The illusion of the end, (1994); Baudrillard J., Aesthetic illusion and virtual reality, Jean Baudrillard: Art and artefact, pp. 19-27, (1997); Baudrillard J., The consumer society: Myths and structures, (1998); Baudrillard J., Screened out, (2002); Brown B., How to do things with things (a toy story), Critical Inquiry, 24, 4, pp. 935-964, (1998); Cascone K., The aesthetics of failure: “Post-digital” tendencies in contemporary computer music, Computer Music Journal, 24, 4, pp. 12-18, (2000); Carroll L., Alice's adventures in wonderland, (1907); Clifford J., On ethnographic allegory, Writing culture: The poetics and politics of ethnography (pp. 98–121), (1986); Demant J., Ravn S., Thorsen S.K., Club studies: Methodological perspectives for researching drug use in a central youth social space, Leisure Studies, 29, 3, pp. 241-252, (2010); Douglas M., Purity and danger: An analysis of concepts of pollution and taboo, (1966); Conservation donation, (2012); Glass P.G., Doing scene: Identity, space and the interactional accomplishment of youth culture, Journal of Contemporary Ethnography, 4, 6, pp. 695-716, (2012); Greener T., Hollands R., Beyond subculture and post-subculture?

However, research into specific tourism contexts is unequal, with live music and festival events often overlooked. This research helps rectify the imbalance by exploring consumer identity formation during a live festival event. Literature first reviews identity theory, before contextualizing to the festival event. Inconsistencies in identity levels, and confusion over the contribution active context plays within identity formation are emphasized. These uncertainties are explored using an interpretivist methodology, namely thematically analyzed, semi-structured interviews and researcher observation. Discussion identifies four unique levels of identity and highlights stimuli that contribute to these levels. Positioned within the ‘Event Identity Model’, Event Identity – a harmonious identity between the individual, other attendees, and the event, is deemed the optimal identity state. Recommendations focus on providing a consistent consumer identity pre-, during, and post-event to increase consumer enjoyment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",consumer identity;event identity;festival event;identity formation;festival;tourism management,festival; tourism management,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Abrams D., Hogg M., Comments on the motivational status of self-esteem in social identity and intergroup discrimination, European Journal of Social Psychology, 18, 4, pp. 317-334, (2006); Ahuvia A., Beyond the extended self: Loved objectives and consumers' identity narratives, Journal of Consumer Research, 32, pp. 171-184, (2005); Aitken P., An observational study of young adults, drinking groups: Drink purchasing procedures, group pressures and alcohol consumption by companions aspredictors of alcohol consumption, Alocohol & Alcoholoism, 20, pp. 445-457, (1985); Arcodia C., Whitford M., Festival attendance and the development of social capital, Journal of Convention and Event Tourism, 8, 2, pp. 1-18, (2007); Ashforth B.E., Role transitions in organizational life: An identity-based perspective, (2001); Ashton-James C., van Baaren R.B., Chartrand T.L., Decety J., Karremans J., Mimicry and me: The impact of mimicry on self-construal, Social Cognition, 25, 4, pp. 518-535, (2007); Barbieri C., Sotomayor S., Surf travel behavior and destination preferences: An application of the Serious Leisure Inverntoy and Measure, Tourism Management, 35, pp. 111-121, (2013); Barnhart M., Penaloza L., Who are you calling old?

However, to date, research on these aspects remains fragmented and indeed lacking within the Italian landscape. Building on these considerations, this article explores the tensions inherent in the reuse and conservation of Italian cultural and historical assets through live events. The research uses three World Heritage sites (WHS) distributed across the Italian territory as case studies to identify the positions of different stakeholders involved in the production of live music performances. A qualitative, comparative, case study design has been deemed as the most fitting to enable an in-depth investigation of the stances held by public and private sector organizations involved in the staging of events at WHS and to enable a rich analysis of the issues. Findings show significant ideological and cultural barriers impacting the use of staged live events at such venues. Besides suggesting a cross-sectorial cooperative approach to help rejuvenate these WHS and to generate funding for conservation purposes findings suggest the need to develop a sustainable strategy for managing national heritage assets incorporating clear guidelines on the reuse of WHS. © 2019 Cognizant, LLC.",creative tourism experiences;events;heritage;live performances;stakeholders' management,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Aas C., Ladkin A., Fletcher J., Stakeholder collaboration and heritage management, Annals of Tourism Research, 32, 1, pp. 28-48, (2005); Aitken R., Campelo A., The four Rs of place branding, Journal of Marketing and Management, 27, 9, pp. 913-933, (2011); Avakian T., 14 Unbelievable concert venues from around the world, (2016); Azara I., Wiltshier P., Greatorex J., Against all odds: Embedding new knowledge for event continuity and community well-being, Event Management, 22, 1, pp. 25-36, (2018); Bennett A., Taylor J., Woodward I., The festivalization of culture, (2014); Berridge G., Events design and experience, (2007); Bryman A., Social research methods, (2015); Bullen P., Adaptive reuse of heritage buildings, Structural Survey, 29, 5, pp. 411-421, (2011); Connell J., Gibson C., Sound tracks: Popular music identity and place, (2003); Corbin J., Strauss A., Basics of qualitative research, (2008); Crang M., Cook I., Doing ethnographies, (2007); Cresswell T., Place: A short introduction, (2004); Creswell J., Research design: Qualitative, quantitative, and mixed method approaches, (2013); Crotty M., The foundations of social research: Meaning and perspective in the research process, (1998); Cuccia T., Guccio C., Rizzo I., The effects of UNESCO World Heritage List inscription on tourism destinations performance in Italian regions, Economic Modelling, 53, pp. 434-508, (2016); Davis A., Experiential places of places of experience?

Some of these events include sporting events and festivals (music, food/beverage, heritage, and art). Some of these events occur for 1 day, but many of these events occur multiple days and are considered “special events.” Determining the positive impact of these special events on local communities is critical to the success of the event and helps to gain local stakeholder approval and acceptance for recurring annual events. The current study surveyed attendees (locals and tourists) at a 5-day special event (festival) in Miami Beach, Florida. Locals and tourists were identified utilizing a new trade market analysis methodology, which was applied to the survey respondents and assessed as a relevant measurement tool for the unique destination. The researchers then estimated the economic impact (using noncasual tourists) to determine the value of the festival to stakeholders in Miami Beach. © The Author(s) 2018.",economic impact;locals;special event;tourists;trade market analysis;festival;tourism market;tourist behavior,Florida [United States]; Miami; United States; economic impact; festival; stakeholder; tourism market; tourist behavior; trade flow,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Alward G., Siverts E., Taylor C., Et al., Micro IMPLAN, User’s Guide, Version 91-F, (1992); Andersson T.D., Lundberg E., Commensurability and sustainability: triple impact assessments of a tourism event, Tourism Management, 37, pp. 99-109, (2013); Park Statistics, National Park Service, (2017); United States Census, (2017); Ap J., Crompton J.L., Residents’ strategies for responding to tourism impacts, Journal of travel research, 32, 1, pp. 47-50, (1993); Auld T., McArthur S., Does event-driven tourism provide economic benefits?

Their answers were coded and analysed.; Findings – Territorial features favour the organisation of festivals. Promoters wish to offer some added value using local products. Festivals broadcast local identity to the world. Festivals’ features as tourist products explain how they are perceived as innovative.; Practical implications – These existing products are being further developed to meet cultural tourism requirements. This strategy is justified by the search for innovation in a fiercely global competitive context.; Originality/value – Current paper focuses on a present product and analyses its transformation: how a territory uses an old strategy in a new way generating future opportunities for tourism sector and local economies. © 2014, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",added value;cultural tourism;diversification;festival;identity;innovation,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Aguilo E., Alegre J., Juaneda C., La viabilidad de los destinos turísticos de masas.

As a result, an event tourism phenomenon has emerged which seeks to exploit events as tourism assets for growing tourism. Such practices may have significant consequences for local communities. This article offers a case study analysis of the 2011 Kangaroo Island Pro-Surf and Music Festival to illustrate how such dynamics can play out. This event was developed by event tourism authorities without pre-consultation with the impacted community, which led to community opposition. This opposition undermined the event's success and future. This work offers a detailed case study that provides some insight into the policy dynamics of the event instigators operating under a neoliberal policy paradigm.

However, tensions may also arise within communities where stakeholder ideologies are at odds regarding the place identity being presented for consumption by tourism practices. Thus, using Mitchell’s model of creative destruction/creative enhancement as a theoretical framework and through qualitative analysis, the purpose of this paper is to critically examine three South Australian festivals from multiple perspectives, to identify what relevant stakeholders consider festivals contribute to the community and how this may impact on the success of the festival itself. Design/methodology/approach – Using Mitchell’s model of creative destruction/creative enhancement as a theoretical framework and through qualitative analysis, this research critically examines three South Australian festivals from multiple perspectives, to identify what relevant stakeholders consider festivals contribute to the community and how this may impact on the success of the festival itself. Findings – Findings suggest that those communities who present a more complex understanding of the “rural idyll” through the integration of multiple local products will experience greater success, both for internal and external audiences. Originality/value – This research represents a unique contribution to the literature on festivals by combining the theoretical construct of cultural value with Mitchell’s model of creative destruction and creative enhancement, particularly within South Australia where little such work has been one, despite the fact that it presents itself as the “Festival State”. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",creative destruction;creative enhancement;cultural value;festival;rural;stakeholders,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Alves H.M.B., Cerro A.M.C., Martins A.V.F., Impacts of small tourism events on rural places, Journal of Place Management and Development, 3, 1, pp. 22-37, (2010); Bardone E., Rattus K., Jaats L., Creative commodification of rural life from a performance perspective: A study of two south-east estonian farm tourism enterprises, Journal of Baltic Studies, 44, 2, pp. 205-227, (2013); Baudrillard J., Simulations, (1983); Blichfeldt B.S., Halkier H., Mussels, tourism and community development: A case study of place branding through food festivals in rural North Jutland, Denmark, European Planning Studies, 22, 8, pp. 1587-1603, (2014); Bowles K., Rural cultural research: Notes from a small country town, Australian Humanities Review, 45, pp. 83-96, (2008); Chang J., Su W.-Y., Chang C.-C., The creative destruction of Ainu community in Hokkaido, Japan, Asia Pacific Journal of Tourism Research, 16, 5, pp. 505-516, (2011); Chang T., Huang S., Recreating place, replacing memory: Creative destruction at the Singapore river, Asia Pacific Viewpoint, 46, 3, pp. 267-280, (2005); Cloke P., Marsden T., Mooney P., The Handbook of Rural Studies, (2006); Crossick G., Kaszynska P., Under construction: Towards a framework for cultural value, Cultural Trends, 3, 2, pp. 120-131, (2014); Deloitte Access Economics, The Economic, Social and Cultural Contribution of Venue-Based Live Music in Victoria, (2011); Fan C., Wall G., Mitchell C., Creative destruction and the water town of Luzhi, China, Tourism Management, 29, 4, pp. 648-660, (2008); Garnham N., From cultural to creative industries.

A theoretical model, comprising four stages: decision; planning; implementation; evaluation, was synthesized from an extensive review of the literature. The theoretical model was then used as a projective instrument for in-depth interviews with managers of three Welsh cultural events: Llangollen International Music Festival, the May Fair at the Museum of Welsh Life, and the Urdd Eisteddfod. From the interviews, three reasonably similar practical models were developed. These late models were then unified in a single best practice model, through the use of Delphi technique. The initial decision phase for the first year of each event differed markedly between events. However, the event managers were able to achieve consensus on a best practice annual managerial model for cultural events. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",cultural events;event management models;event tourism;project instrument,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Allen J., O'Toole W., Harris R., McDonnell I., Festival and special event management, (2012); Armstrong J., Planning special events, (2001); Attenburrow B., The Llangollen International Eisteddfod: Fifty glorious weeks: 1947-1996, (1996); Bramwell L., Hykawy E., The Delphi technique: A possible tool for predicting future events in nursing education, Canadian Journal of Nursing Research, 30, 4, pp. 47-58, (1999); Bull C., Jane Lovell J., The impact of hosting major sporting events on local residents: An analysis of the views and perceptions of Canterbury residents in relation to the tour de France 2007, Journal of Sport & Tourism, 12, 3-4, pp. 229-248, (2007); Chang J.E., The revival of projective techniques: Past, present and future perspectives, Advances in Consumer Research, 28, 1, pp. 253-254, (2001); Davies G., The story of the Urdd: 1922-1972, (1973); Doran G.T., There's a S.M.A.R.T. way to write management goals and objectives, Management Review, 70, 11, pp. 35-36, (1981); Dwyer L., Modeling the impact of Australia's mining boom on tourism: A classic case of Dutch disease, Journal of Travel Research, 45, 1, pp. 59-66, (2006); Ferdinand N., Kitchin P., Events management: An international approach, (2012); Fredline L., Jago L., Deery M., The development of a generic scale to measure the social impacts of events, Event Management, 8, 1, pp. 23-37, (2003); Getz D., Event management and event tourism, (2005); Getz D., Event studies: Theory, research and policy for planned events, (2012); Goldblatt J.J., Special events: Best practices in modern events management, (2005); Green H., Hunter C., Moore B., Application of the Delphi technique in tourism, Annals of Tourism Research, 17, 2, pp. 270-279, (1990); Gursoy D., Kindall K.W., Hosting mega events: Modeling locals' support, Annals of Tourism Research, 33, 3, pp. 603-623, (2006); Hall C.M., Hallmark tourist events - Impacts, management and planning, (1992); Hassay D.N., Smith M.C., Fauna, foraging and shopping motives, Advances in Consumer Research, 23, 1, pp. 510-515, (1996); Jago L., Shaw R., Special events: A conceptual and definitional framework, Festival Management & Event Tourism, 15, 1-2, pp. 21-32, (1998); Lilienfeld S.O., Wood J.M., Garb H.N., The scientific status of projective techniques, Psychological Science, 1, 2, pp. 27-66, (2000); Long P.T., Perdue R.R., The economic impact of rural festivals and special events: Assessing the spatial distribution of expenditure, Journal of Travel Research, 28, 4, pp. 10-14, (1990); Malcolm D.G., Roseboom J.H., Clark C.E., Fazar W., Application of a technique for Research and Development program evaluation, Operations Research, 7, pp. 646-669, (1959); Salem G., Jones E., Morgan N., An overview of special event management, Festivals and event management: An international arts and culture perspective, pp. 14-31, (2012); Veal J., Research methods for leisure and tourism a practical guide, (1997); Walker M., Kaplanidou K., Gibson H., Thapa B., Geldenhuys S., Coetzee W., Win in Africa, with Africa: Social responsibility, event image, and destination benefits.

Newly established vineyards refer back to the local traditions of grape cultivations which vanished for the variety of reasons. Vineyards are typically small family businesses. The profiles of winemakers show that they are most often educated persons, arriving from cities, who follow their passion and consider winemaking as a supplementary source of income. They are aware of the value of local products, traditions and harmonious landscape and expose these values in both the process of win-emaking itself, as well as in developing wine tourism. They support and organize new activities such as music events, recreational events, and guest presentations. Vineyards are new elements of the rural landscape, but they are historically justified and harmoniously integrated with the topography, whereas associated infrastructure usually represents good examples of revitalization of existing buildings, occasionally of architectural value. Due to the family-type business on the vineyards it is rather premature to infer their direct positive influ-ence on local employment and incomes. Nevertheless, due to the growth of wine tourism local suppliers are expected to increasingly benefit from this development trend. © 2020, Polska Akademia Nauk.

Using participatory observation, this exploratory study examines and analyzes three specific destinations where tourists engage with both death and dystopia. Through our examination of the Charles Manson 'Helter Skelter Tour' in Los Angeles, the H.R. Giger Museum in Gruyeres, Switzerland and the Inferno Music Festival in both Lausanne, Switzerland and Oslo, Norway, we present a model of dystopian dark tourism that integrates dark aesthetics, simulation, emotional contagion and the current global cultural fascination with both utopia and dystopia. We posit that interest in dystopian dark tourism experiences is reflective of an increased insecurity about death, society and its relationship to violence and cultural production. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",dark aesthetics;dark tourism;dystopia;emotional contagion;simulation theory;norway;heritage tourism;philosophy;tourist destination,California; Lausanne; Los Angeles [California]; Norway; Oslo [Norway]; Oslo [Oslo (CNT)]; Switzerland; United States; Vaud; esthetics; heritage tourism; philosophy; tourist destination,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Aites A., Ewell A., Until the light takes us, (2008); Ali L., Helter shelter, (1994); Arnould E., Thompson C., Consumer culture theory (CCT): twenty years of research, Journal of Consumer Research, 31, 4, pp. 868-882, (2005); Askegaard S., Linnet J.T., Towards an epistemology of consumer culture theory: phenomenology and context of context, Marketing Theory, 11, 4, pp. 381-404, (2011); Ayers M., The enduring fascination of the Sharon Tate murder, (2012); Baudrillard J., The transparency of evil: Essays on extreme phenomenon, (1993); Baudrillard J., Disneyworld company, (1994); Baudrillard J., Passwords, (2003); Baumeister R., Campbell K., The intrinsic appeal of evil: sadism, sensational thrills, and threatened egotism, Personality and Social Psychology Review, 3, 3, pp. 210-221, (1999); Belk R., May the farce be with: on Las Vegas and consumer infantalization, Consumption, Markets & Culture, 4, 2, pp. 101-124, (2000); Biran A., Poria Y., Oren G., Sought experiences at (dark) heritage sites, Annals of Tourism Research, 38, 3, pp. 820-841, (2011); Hrgiger.com, (1998); Booker M.K., The dystopian impulse in modern literature: Fiction as social criticism, (1994); Bryman A., Social research methods, (2008); Buda D., d'Hauteserre A., Johnston L., Feeling and tourism studies, Annals of Tourism Research, 46, MAY, pp. 102-114, (2014); Bugliosi V., Gentry C., Helter Skelter: The true story of the Manson murders, (1974); Campion C., In the face of death, (2005); Clute J., Nicholls P., The encyclopedia of science fiction, (1993); Cooper E.D., The Manson problem, The Manson murders: A philosophical inquiry, pp. 1-16, (1974); Coplan A., Catching characters' emotions: emotional contagion responses to narrative fan fiction, Film Studies, 8, pp. 26-38, (2006); DeWalt K.M., DeWalt B.R., Wayland C.B., Participant observation, Handbook of methods in cultural anthropology, pp. 259-299, (1998); Dobscha S., Drenten J., Drummond K., Gabel T., Hackley C., Levy S., Et al., Death and all his friends: the role of identity, ritual, and disposition in the consumption of death, Advances in consumer research, 40, pp. 1098-1099, (2012); Duncum P., Attractions to violence and the limits of education, The Journal of Aesthetic Education, 40, pp. 21-38, (2006); Dunkley R., Morgan N., Westwood S., A shot in the dark?

Hosting such events creates benefits, these include the boost in the local economy, improvement of infrastructure on destinations and job creation. The purpose of this paper was to investigate how events tourism could be utilised as a conduit to promote underdeveloped tourist destinations in Mooiplaas. Secondary data sources were consulted to understand the role of events tourism in the local community of Mooiplaas. This paper utilised a survey questionnaire to collect data. The simple random sampling method was utilised to select the respondents. The findings indicate that 70% of the respondents agreed that they are consulted about the events that promote their community. Furthermore, the findings elucidates that 82% of the respondents concur that events can potentially create entrepreneurial opportunities. These findings contribute significantly in developing the local economic strategies of the municipalities in underdeveloped regions. As such it is recommended that events are planned in a coherent, systematic manner in order to achieve local economic development objectives. Furthermore, the paper provided a foundation on how to plan, organise, lead and control events that can potentially unearth tourism demand particularly in developing tourist destinations. Moreover, it is hoped that the paper will serve as the basis to plan future events in the context of regions such as Mooiplaas that are still engulfed with developmental challenges, these contribute to triple threat of unemployed, poverty and inequality. © 2020 Africa Journals.",events tourism;local community;strategy;tourism development,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Adams C., Dodd T., Kolyesnikova N., Yuan J., Motivation of young people for visiting wine festivals, Event Management, 10, 1, pp. 3-14, (2006); Alexandris K., Kaplanidou K., Marketing sport events tourism: Sport tourist behaviour and destination provisions, Sport marketing quarterly, special issue: Marketing sport event tourism, 23, 3, pp. 125-126, (2014); Allen J., O'Toole W., Harris R., McDonnell I., Festival and Special Event Management, (2008); Allen J., O'Toole W., Harris R., McDonnell I., Festival & special event management, (2011); Arellano A., A history of Quebec-branded: The staging of the New France festival, Event Management, 15, 1, pp. 1-12, (2011); Barnham C., Quantitative and qualitative research: Perceptual foundations, International Journal of Market Research, 57, 6, (2015); Berg B., Qualitative Research Methods for the Social Sciences, (2009); Boo S., Koh Y., Jones D., An exploration of attractiveness of convention cities based on visit behaviour, Journal of convention and event tourism, 9, 4, pp. 239-257, (2008); Bowdin G., Events Management, (2011); Brown C., Busser J.A., Baloglu S., Sport tourists in a gaming destination: Predicting gaming and non-gaming expenditures, UNLV Gambling Research and Review Journal, 14, 2, pp. 59-68, (2010); Festival to jazz up Cape Town economy, (2016); Cole S.T., Illum S.F., Examining the mediating role of festival visitors' satisfaction in the relationship between service quality and behavioural intentions, Journal of Vacation Marketing, 12, 2, pp. 160-173, (2006); Cresswell J., Educational Research: Planning, Conducting and Evaluating Qualitative and Quantitative Research, (2012); Creswell J.W., Research design: Qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods approaches, (2013); Lee S., Jeon S., Kim D., The impact of tour quality and tourist satisfaction on tourist loyalty: The case of Chinese tourists in Korea, Tourism Management, 32, pp. 1115-1124, (2011); Leedy P.D., Practical research planning and design, (2010); Liu Y., Chen C., Frontiers of Architecture and Civil Engineering in China, The effects of festivals and special events on city image design, 1, 2, pp. 255-259, (2007); Mair J., The greening of music festivals: Motivations, barriers and outcomes.

Particularly, the paper analyses the specific negative effects generated via “overtourism” for the duration of large-scale music festivals. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses a case study method approach to examine the negative effects that UNTOLD, the largest music festival in Romania, has on residents’ quality of life. The case is analysed via a comprehensive desk research of secondary data from industry and academic sources. Findings: Despite its success and the positive economic impact UNTOLD festival had on the host city, several issues have a negative impact on residents’ quality of life and well-being. The negative impacts are noise pollution, vandalism and crime, traffic and parking issues, waste and damages to the natural environment, pressure on and over usage of local services and infrastructure and the increased cost of living. Social implications: Whilst organisers, local businesses and local authorities are the main parties benefiting from events, residents mainly feel the negative impact. Organisers, local authorities and businesses need to minimise the negative effects residents’ experience during the event by building sustainable partnerships and taking a more hands-on approach to sustainable and socially responsible practices. Current and potential initiatives are discussed in the paper. Originality/value: This paper examines the negative impacts events may have on residents’ quality of life and discusses the case of a large-scale music festival, an under-researched context. The analysis and discussion may assist scholars and industry experts alike in generating new debates in sustainable event management practices, as well as festival organisers and public authorities in developing strategies for avoiding, containing or minimising the negative effects of events. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",event tourism;festival;negative impacts;overtourism;quality of life;romania,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Cluj-Napoca, fără locuri de cazare în perioada festivalului untold.

Large indoor entertainment venues meet this need through the provision of entertainment such as live music performances. While large indoor entertainment venues impact the economies of the communities in which they are located, there is minimal research that investigates their economic contribution. To address this gap, this article examines the inscope expenditure arising from a range of events held at the Sydney Entertainment Centre (SEC) for the areas surrounding it-Chinatown/Haymarket precinct, the Darling Harbour precinct, and the City of Sydney local government area. It was found that the SEC benefits the immediate venue location, as well as adjacent business precincts, with backward and forward economic linkages evident in visitor expenditure patterns. Surprisingly, free concerts were also found to generate high expenditures in surrounding areas. Implications for stakeholders are discussed. © 2014 Cognizant Comm.

Setting out as a small-scale cultural revival of Serbian brass orchestra tradition held annually in the village of Guca in the Dragacevo region of western Serbia, the festival has evolved over time into a great World Music spectacle. Disputes about the interpretation and representation of the national past and musical heritage have long been induced in public by the unsettled political situation in Serbia and by the festival's gradual integration into the global music industry and cultural tourism market. In consequence, the festival's relationship to issues of authenticity, tradition preservation, globalization impact, and representation politics continues to be viewed and discussed through familiar dichotomies. Using the interrelated theoretical models from World Music and cultural tourism studies, this paper aims to explore the reasons for the festival's prominent status in national cultural policies, as well as the contradictory meanings that it has generated in a variety of discourses. © 2012 © 2012 Taylor & Francis.",globalization;national heritage;representation politics;world music,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Andric G., Tourist sector pins hopes on month of fun, Belgrade insight, 96, (2011); Babic D., Prica o srpskoj trubi [The story of Serbian trumpet], (2004); Bojovic Z., Guca: Svetski festival ili letnja manifestacija?, Radio slobodna evropa [online], (2009); Brusila J., Jungle drums striking the world beat: Africa as an image factor in popular music, Encounter images in the meetings between Africa and Europe, pp. 146-161, (2001); Cartwright G., Europe's wildest party, The guardian, (2009); Feld S., A sweet lullaby for world music, Public culture, 12, 1, pp. 145-171, (2000); Golemovic D.O., Mesto i uloga limenih duvackih orkestara u narodnoj muzickoj praksi Srbije, Zbornik Matice srpske za scenske umetnosti i muziku [Matica Srpska Proceedings for Performance Arts and Music], 18-19, pp. 59-68, (1996); Golemovic D.O., World music.

The purpose of this paper is twofold. Firstly to estimate the demand for a music event using two non-market valuation techniques; stated choice and travel cost method (TCM), and secondly to compare the welfare measures estimated from the two methods and discuss their relevance for event policy and management. We use survey data collected from 1005 visitors to the Peace & Love music festival held in Borlänge, Sweden, in 2012. The survey contains questions about the actual behaviour of the respondents such as expenditure patterns and travel behaviour but also a stated choice experiment (SCE). The latter asks the respondents to choose between different scenarios with varying levels of price, number of visitors and length of the festival in days. These data allow us to estimate consumer surplus for the event by applying both the TCM and SCE. The findings of our study are that the price effect, as expected, is negative and significant, more people attending the festival decreases the propensity to attend while longer duration of the festival increases the propensity to attend. This paper contributes to the literature on event impact analysis by highlighting the potential for using stated choice data on visitor preferences in combination with actual visitor data to understand current and future economic impact of an event. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",music festival;stated choice experiment;tourism impact;travel cost method;sweden;economic impact;music;tourism,Sweden; demand analysis; economic impact; estimation method; music; tourism; travel behavior; welfare economics,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Andersson T.D., Armbrecht J., Lundberg E., Estimating use and non-use values of a music festival, Scandinavian Journal of Hospitality & Tourism, 12, 3, pp. 215-231, (2012); Boardman W., Greenberg D.H., Vining A.R., Weimer D., Cost-benefit analysis: concepts and practice, (2014); Burgan B., Mules T., Reconciling cost-benefit and economic impact assessment for event tourism, Tourism Economics, 7, 4, pp. 321-330, (2001); Chotikapanich D., Griffiths W.E., Carnarvon Gorge: A comment on the sensitivity of consumer surplus estimation to functional form specification, Australian Journal of Agricultural & Resource Economics, 42, 3, pp. 249-261, (1998); Clawson M., Knetsch J.L., Economics of outdoor recreation, (1966); Day B., (2000); Douglas A.J., Taylor J.A., A new model for the travel cost method: the total expenses approach, Environmental Modelling and Software, 14, 1, pp. 81-92, (1998); Dwyer L., Forsyth P., Public sector support for special events, Eastern Economic Journal, 35, pp. 481-499, (2009); Fleming C., Cook A., The recreational value of Lake McKenzie, Fraser Island: An application of the travel cost method, Tourism Management, 29, 6, pp. 1197-1205, (2008); Heldt T., Klerby A., (2011); Heldt T., Olofsson M., (2011); Heldt T., Olofsson M., (2012); Holmes T.P., Adamowicz W.L., Attribute-based models, A primer on non-market valuation, pp. 171-219, (2003); Lee C.-K., Taylor T., Critical reflections on the economic impact assessment of a mega-event: The case of 2002 FIFA World Cup, Tourism Management, 26, 4, pp. 595-603, (2005); Li S., A simple framework for evaluating the economic welfare of a large event, Tourism Analysis, 17, pp. 473-493, (2010); List J., Gallet C., What experimental protocol influences disparities between actual and hypothetical stated values?, Environmental and Resource Economics, 20, pp. 241-254, (2001); Louviere J.J., Hensher D.A., Using discrete choice models with experimental design data to forecast consumer demand for a unique cultural event, Journal of Consumer Research, 10, 3, pp. 348-361, (1983); Louviere J.J., Hensher D.A., Swait J.D., Stated choice methods: Analysis & application, (2000); Mazzanti M., Discrete choice models & valuation experiments, Journal of Economic Studies, 30, 6, pp. 584-604, (2003); Mules B., Dwyer L., Public sector support for sport tourism events: The role of cost-benefit analysis, Sport in Society, 8, 2, pp. 338-355, (2005); Pearce D., Atkinson G., Mourato S., Cost-benefit analysis and the environment: Recent developments, (2006); Prayaga P., Rolfe J., Sinden J., A travel cost analysis of the value of special events: Gemfest in Central Queensland, Tourism Economics, 12, 3, pp. 403-420, (2006); Small K.A., Rosen H.S., Applied welfare economics with discrete choice models, Econometrica, 49, pp. 105-130, (1981); Snowball J., Willis K., Estimating the marginal utility of different sections of an arts festival: The case of visitors to the South African National Arts Festival, Leisure Studies, 25, 1, pp. 43-56, (2006); Train K., Discrete choice methods with simulation, (2003); Walton H., Longo A., Dawson P., A contingent valuation of the 2012 London Olympic Games, Journal of Sports Economics, 9, 3, pp. 304-317, (2008); Ward F.A., Beal D., Valuing nature with travel cost models: A manual, (2000)","T.

The study emphasizes the mediating effect tourist satisfaction has on the relationship between emotional experiences and destination loyalty. The validities and reliabilities of the measures used were examined through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and correlation analysis using 230 domestic and international participants who attended a marathon race as amateur athletes. Structural equation modeling analysis with maximum likelihood estimation was conducted to investigate relationships between study variables. Findings disclosed the positive impacts of (a) emotional experiences on tourist satisfaction and destination loyalty, (b) novelty seeking on tourist satisfaction, and (c) tourist satisfaction on destination loyalty, and demonstrated that (d) tourist satisfaction fully mediates the relationship between emotional experiences and destination loyalty. Based on its results, this study (a) indicates that emotional experiences play key roles in predicting tourist satisfaction and destination loyalty, (b) provides an example of the merits of the Destination Emotion Scale (DES) in a sport tourism setting, (c) implies that both emotional experiences and novelty seeking should be incorporated into tourist behavior models, and (d) contributes to tourism studies by exploring the mediating effect of tourist satisfaction on the relation between emotional experiences and destination loyalty. Thus, destination managers should manage gorgeous natural views and beautiful cityscapes, and organize various fun events, such as prize and ticket giveaway events, music performances, and charity campaigns for tourists during events. © 2019 by the authors.

Destinations around the world are utilising festivals as a draw card to boost local economies. The current paper aimed to investigate economic impacts of Buyel'Ekhaya Pan-African Cultural Music Festival (BPACMF) on East London residents in the province of Eastern Cape, South Africa. Despite the fact that East London city has successfully hosted this festival over the past nine years, its economic level of contribution on local residents is dubious. Qualitative and quantitative research approaches were used to assess the economic impacts of BPACMF on residents of East London city. Semi-structured questionnaires were administered to 200 residents living around the area where the event takes place. Purposive and stratified sampling methods were applicable to identify the selected areas. Random sampling was applied to choose respondents. The data was captured and analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 22. The results revealed that BPACMF contributes to East London city's economy, through short term job creation. However, residents feel that local businesses are the main beneficiaries rather than ordinary citizens. A low level of residents' involvement in the decision-making and as part of the organising team were notable. The researchers recommend that the event organisers should create a balance to ensure even distribution of BPACMF economic benefits to all stakeholders, especially residents. Government needs to create an awareness and educate residents to capitalise on festivals for economic gains in the communities in which they reside. © 2017 AJHTL.",economic impacts;events;festival tourism;resident;south africa,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Bob U., Swart K., Resident perceptions of the 2010 FIFA soccer world cup stadia development in Cape Town, Urban Forum, 20, pp. 47-59, (2009); Buch T., Residents' perceptions of events: Taupo and ironman, New Zealand, (2006); Derrett R., Regional festivals: nourishing community resilience: the nature and role of cultural festivals in northern rivers nsw communities, (2008); Derrett R., Festivals, events and the destination, Festival and events management: an international arts and culture perspective, pp. 32-50, (2004); Etiosa O., The impacts of event tourism on host communities: Case-the city of Pietarsaari, (2012); Felsenstein D., Fleischer A., Local festivals and tourism promotion: the role of public assistance and visitor expenditure, Journal of Travel Research, 41, 4, pp. 200-300, (2003); Fredline L., Host community reactions to motorsport events: The perception of impact on quality of life, Sport tourism: interrelationships, impacts and issues, (2004); Fredline E., Host community reactions to major sporting events: the gold coast indy and the Australian formula one grand prix in Melbourne, (2000); Fredline E., Faulkner B., Host community reactions: a cluster analysis, Annals of Tourism Research, 27, 3, pp. 763-784, (2000); Irshad H., Impacts of community events and festivals on rural places, (2011); Isaac S., Michael W.B., Handbook in research and evaluation: a collection of principles, methods, and strategies useful in the planning, design, and evaluation of studies in education and the behavioural sciences, (1981); Ivanovic M., Khunou P.S., Reynish N., Pawson R., Tseane L., Wassung G., Tourism development: fresh perspective, (2009); Kemang L., The role of the Morija Arts and Cultural Festival as a mechanism for promoting tourism among local communities, (2012); Keyser H., Tourism development, (2002); Kim H.J., Gursoy D., Lee S.B., The impact of the 2002 world cup on South Korea: comparison of pre-and post-games, Tourism Management, 27, pp. 86-96, (2006); Kim S.S., Petrick J.F., Residents' perceptions on impacts of the FIFA 2002 world cup: the case of Seoul as a host city, Tourism Management, 26, pp. 25-38, (2005); Magadla Q., Tighter security for music festival, (2015); McKercher M., Wan Sze M., Tse T.S.M., Are short duration cultural festivals tourist attractions?, Journal of Sustainable Tourism, 14, 1, pp. 55-66, (2006); Moscardo G., Analyzing the role of festivals and events in regional development, Event Management, 11, 1-2, pp. 23-30, (2007); Muller M., Popular perceptions of urban transformation through mega-events: understanding support for the 2014 winter Olympics in Sochi, Environment and planning: government and policy, 30, (2011); Mxunyelwa S., The social impacts of sport events tourism on selected location communities in East London, with specific reference to the spec-savers ironman South Africa triathlon, (2011); Oliphant K.B., Profiling of attendees at hallmark event, (2012); Quinn B., Arts festivals, urban tourism and cultural policy, Journal of Policy Research in Tourism, Leisure and Events, 2, pp. 264-279, (2010); Quinn B., Problematising 'festival tourism': arts festivals and sustainable development in Ireland, Journal of Sustainable Tourism, 14, 3, pp. 288-306, (2006); Reid S., Identify social consequences of rural events, Event management, 11, 1-2, pp. 89-98, (2007); Rentscher R., Bridson K., Evans J., Regional development, (2013); Ritchie J., The applications of qualitative methods to social research, Qualitative research practice: A guide for social science students and researchers, pp. 24-46, (2003); Rogerson M., Harmer D., A 'rite of passage' youth festival in South Africa: the origins, attendees and organization of matric vac, Nordic Journal of African Studies, 24, 3-4, pp. 221-240, (2015); Rogerson M., Restructuring the geography of domestic tourism in South Africa, Bulletin of Geography: Socio-Economic Series, 29, pp. 119-135, (2015); Rogerson M., Reframing place-based economic development in South Africa: the example of local economic development, (2014); Arts and culture continues to support the annual Buyel'ekhaya Pan African Music Festival, (2014); City population.

However, unlike much of the cruise experience, musical performance does not directly generate income. Such performances instead act as semiotic guides informing them, for example, that the afternoon may be spent lazing by the pool, or that evenings are constructed as high-class theatrical events, or as party time in the disco. Further, such musical performances encourage guests to attend spaces that generate income (such as bars, lido deck, and casinos) and dissuade them from attending spaces where income is unlikely to be generated (such as their cabin). This research considers the implementation of musical performances on cruise ships using two data sources. Qualitative data is drawn from ship programs describing the actual placement of music. Quantitative data is drawn from interviews with industry personnel describing the intentions of music placement. It finds that periods when guests are on board, such as evenings and sea days, engenders most of the musical performance. This produces revenue that reverts to the ship. Certain genres occur at different times on different days, such as Caribbean/Latin American-themed music occurring on sea days, or cocktail piano occurring in the evening, further acting as semiotic guides. This constructed artistic product attracts people to undertake a cruise, makes a cruise memorable, and informs their experience of the cruise ship tourism product. © 2016 Cognizant, LLC.",consumption;cruise;live music,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Areni C.S., Kim D., The influence of background music on shopping behavior: Classical versus top-forty music in a wine store, Advances in Consumer Research, 20, 1, pp. 336-340, (1993); Atkinson C.Z., Whose New Orleans?

Though the band as an entity ceased to exist in 1995, various spin-off groups from surviving members continue to tour and play the band's music. Furthermore, numerous other events continue to use the Grateful Dead name and legacy to gain attention and attract visitors. Despite the fact the band and its fans-the Deadheads-have been explored by researchers in a variety of academic fields and disciplines, there are relatively few studies that directly investigate the tourism and events aspects of group, particularly given that fan travel and the band's unique concert scene remain integral components of the Grateful Dead experience. Therefore, this article explores the ways in which existing research about the Grateful Dead from other academic fields intersects with topics and issues in tourism and events and suggests that there are numerous avenues for tourism and events researchers to directly explore the ongoing Grateful Dead phenomenon. © 2019 Cognizant, LLC.",events;grateful dead;music heritage;tourism,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Adams R.G., Terrapin station demographics and ""deadication, Reading the Grateful Dead: A critical survey, pp. 193-205, (2012); Adams R.G., Harmon J.T., Intentional sub-communities and identity continuity among baby boomers: Grateful Dead fans, Handbook of community movements and local organizations in the 21st Century, pp. 337-351, (2018); Blau J.A., A phan on Plush: Live improvised music in five performative commitments, Cultural Studies-Critical Methodologies, 10, 4, pp. 307-319, (2010); Campbell R.B., A sense of place: Examining music-based tourism and its implications in destination venue placement, (2011); Dollar N., Mapping the deadhead social science trip, Reading the Grateful Dead: A critical survey, pp. 49-64, (2012); Eisner E., Blavatnik N., Kreutzmann J., Dornstein K., Bar-Lev A., Long strange trip: The untold story of the Grateful Dead, (2017); Erdely J.L., Breede D.C., Tales from the tailgate: The influence of fandom, musical tourism and pilgrimage on identity transformations, The Journal of Fandom Studies, 5, 1, pp. 43-62, (2017); Gazel R.C., Schwer R.K., Beyond rock and roll: The economic impact of the Grateful Dead on a local economy, Journal of Cultural Economics, 21, 1, pp. 41-55, (1997); Green J., Management secrets of the Grateful Dead, The Atlantic Monthly, 305, 2, (2010); Gunderman H.C., Harty J.P., The music never stopped"": Naming businesses as a method for remembering the Grateful Dead, Journal of Cultural Geography, 34, 3, pp. 373-395, (2017); Guthmann E., A tale of two tribes: A gay man's adventure in the world of deadheads, The Grateful Dead reader, (2000); Hunt P.M., From festies to tourrats: Examining the relationship between jamband subculture involvement and role meanings, Social Psychology Quarterly, 71, 4, pp. 356-378, (2008); Jackson B., This darkness got to give: Some thoughts on problems in the dead scene, The Grateful Dead reader, pp. 233-238, (2000); Jennings S., Becoming a Deadhead, Deadheadsocialscience: You ain't gonna learn what you don't want to know, pp. 203-213, (2000); McCabe S., Who is a tourist?

It examines the sources of stakeholder power and the pattern of interdependence of various stakeholders, primarily based on interviews with event managers and stakeholders, as well as field visits. An analysis of the different types and amount of resource control, dependency, and network centrality resulted in four different categories of stakeholder power patterns-executive, asset based, referral, and diffuse stakeholders. The study also found that resource-based power was the primary source of power, whereas network-based power was a secondary and supplementary source. The case study revealed that the salience of event stakeholders based on their power was highly variable due to the different types of power that they had. This article contributes to the literature of event tourism, a typology of the event stakeholder powers in a predominately government-owned music festival, and offered practical suggestions to event management. It also advances the stakeholder power concept within event tourism studies. © 2015 Cognizant Comm.

In his 1960 book Crowd and Power, Elias Canetti explains that: 'The most important occurrence within the crowd is the discharge. Before this the crowd does not actually exist; it is the discharge, which creates it. This is the moment when all who belong to the crowd get rid of their differences and feel equal' (Canetti 1962, p. 17). On July 15, 1989, the city of Venice was stormed by a large crowd that had reached the city in order to assist to a free and open-air concert of the English rock band Pink Floyd. United by music, the crowd occupied the city and became the symbol of a 'continuous opposition between past and present' and a clash between two ideas of the city. The concert given by Pink Floyd on the evening of July 15, 1989 forever remains in the collective memories as a static image: that of a crowd that far surpasses the capabilities of an island city like Venice. However, the backstage and the story of this event are complex and extend well beyond the ninety minutes of the concert. Crowds are a constant of rock concerts: The Beatles New York's Shea Stadium concert on August 15, 1965, attracting more than 55,600 fans, marked a paradigm shift and is considered by specialists as the first mass rock concert. Rock invasions often use abandoned, open sites, stadiums or squares, and more rarely theatres. They create a landscape always constituted by the crowd, a formless magma surrounded by sound and crossed by beams of light which concentrate on the stage to enlighten the star or the musicians. During A Momentary Lapse of Reasons world tour (that lasted from September 9, 1987 to June 30, 1990), members of Pink Floyd decide to perform in some unusual places - such as the Château of Versailles or the Olympic Stadium in Moscow (respectively on June 21, 1988 and on June 3, 1989) - thus marking a publicity stunt while offering a unique moment and extraordinary to their fans. Following this, Francesco Tomasi, promoter for the tour's Italian part, had the idea of organizing a free concert in the lagoon, on the occasion of the Festa del Redentore, the most popular of all Venetian celebrations. According to the tradition, the concert had to be seen and heard as much from the boats gathered in San Marco's basin as from Piazzetta San Marco. The concert was to take place on a floating stage of 97 x 24 x 24 m, thus putting under the spotlight, in San Marco's basin, one of the most popular rock bands of all time with, as background, the fabulous scenography of Venice. The idea of playing in the open-air, in an historical site and in front of a large crowd, was both closely linked and diametrically opposed to another of Pink Floyd's extraordinary performance. In 1971, the young Scottish director Adrian Maben had the idea of a film in which Pink Floyd would play in an empty Pompei amphitheatre, at the foot of Monte Vesuvio, a space with remarkable acoustics. A sort of anti-Woodstock, Live at Pompeii's mission was to focus solely on music in its relationship to the place, to its spirit, its genius, its memory. Released in 1972, the musical film Live at Pompeii constitute an original and paradoxical example of the marriage between rock music and historical places. Pink Floyd's 1989 concert in Venice also reached a virtual crowd with repercussions that went far beyond the lagoon. Filmed by fifteen cameras and broadcasted live it was watched by more than one hundred million viewers from twenty-three countries, it marked history, as much for its media reach than for the real physical experience it provided to its participants and the inhabitants of Venice. Thanks to Mondovision, a technology first used in the late Nineteen-Sixties and which implies the simultaneous broadcast of a television program in as many countries of the world as possible, the concert was retransmitted in England, Spain, the Netherlands, Portugal, Belgium, Turkey, France, Greece, Norway, Finland, Sweden, the Soviet Union and both Germanys. On the evening of July 15, the audience well exceeds the 50,000 expected spectators, causing a panic in the lagoon city. A few hours before the concert, the Ponte della Libertà, which connects Venice to the mainland, was closed to cars, limiting access to the city that only then became accessible by train, boat or on foot. On Piazza San Marco, fans climb on the Palazzo delle Prigioni Vecchie and on the façade of the Biblioteca Marciana entrance - and up to the roof of the vaporetto pier located opposite the Ponte della Paglia, not far from the Ponte dei Sospiri. The number of policeman was quickly insufficient and reinforcements were sent from Mestre and Padua. Eventually, the police had to charge the uncontrollable crowd near Ponte della Paglia and Torre dell'Orologio, but without any success. Pink Floyd's Venice concert lasted exactly one hour and a half and concluding with the song Run Like Hell, followed by the traditional fireworks of the Redentore. Once the party ended, the debacle began: streets were blocked by the crowd that was heading towards the bus station of Piazzale Roma. The flow of people leaving Piazza San Marco met with that of the people who were camped at Campo Santo Stefano, watching the concert on a giant screen. The journey from San Marco to Piazzale Roma took around 1.5 hours. And, in Piazzale Roma, another surprise awaits the fans: the public transport company has launched a strike and no buses were running that day. No taxis either. Someone tries, in vain, to put pressure on a truck driver. Finally, out of desperation, the crowd decided to cross the Ponte della Libertà on foot to reach the mainland. Widely disseminated by the media, images of the concert - and mostly apocalyptic photographs and films shot after the passage of the crowd - travelled the world. The real protagonists of this story were not the Pink Floyd but the crowd that, on July 15, 1989, invaded every possible corner of Venice's land and water. Yet the crowd of Pink Floyd's concert was also announcing a more pervasive and impactful one. To come back to Canetti's words, it is evident that a form of discharge happens when the unified magma of mass tourists enters Venice everyday, as if it was an attraction park. © 2022 by the authors.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Floydseum Associazione Culturale, The Night of Wonders.

An increase in music festivals in the United States in the last decade has resulted in managers recruiting and managing volunteers to operate music festivals. This research examines relationships between moderating variables and factors of self-image congruency, motivation, satisfaction, and intent to return as a volunteer at Austin City Limits, a large-scale music festival in the United States.

The study advances the 5E's framework in festival experience for Gen Y by adjusting the dependent variable of interest to that of eWOM. The adjustment to the model framework is done in order to address some prominent challenges of confined island economies with regard to festival production, such as: restrictive market access, limited capital for promotions, and the need for generational market succession to sustain tourist arrivals. The research uses the case study of the Aruba Electric Festival, which was created by tourism officials in order to increase Gen Y tourist arrivals without deflecting other generational cohorts from arriving to the island. The study recognizes the importance of creating a music festival experience that would influence attendees’ intentions to promote the event and destination via eWOM, thus increasing market reach and decreasing promotional expenses. The data was assessed using a structural equation model. The results reveal that if festival organizers craft an overall memorable music festival experience that incorporates the 5Es, then Gen Y attendees are likely to provide positive eWOM for the festival and the destination. The results address some immediate industry concerns of Aruba's destination managers and festival organizers. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",5es model;electronic word of mouth (ewom);experience economy;gen y;music festival;small island destinations (sids);social networking sites,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Abubakar A.M., Ilkan M., Impact of online WOM on destination trust and intention to travel: A medical tourism perspective, Journal of Destination Marketing & Management, (2016);

More precisely, existing consumer loyalty models do not consider social and cultural dimensions highlighted by tourism literature. Using new institutional theory, this article proposes a new perspective to explain loyalty. This study of musical festival patrons and managers combines cognitive mapping and questionnaires. Findings demonstrate that shared values between managers and festival-goers influence the latter’s loyalty. More precisely, shared values impact attitudinal loyalty and word-of-mouth, but they do not affect behavioral loyalty. Results also show that festival-goer loyalty decreases more slowly over time when a high level of shared values exist. Beyond music festivals, this study highlights a more sociological approach to explain loyalty over time in tourism. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",festival;loyalty;new institutional theory;shared values;time effect;music;tourism,music; tourism,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Aaker J.L., Dimensions of Brand Personality, Journal of Marketing Research, 34, pp. 347-356, (1997); Abrahamson E., Fombrun C.J., Macrocultures: Determinants and consequences, Academy of Management Review, 29, 2, pp. 175-194, (1994); Andersson T.D., Getz D., Tourism as a Mixed Industry: Differences between Private, Public and Not-for-Profit Festivals, Tourism Management, 30, 6, pp. 847-856, (2009); Arnold S., Kozinets R.V., Handelman J.M., Hometown Ideology and Retailer Legitimation: The Institutional Semiotics of Wal-Mart Flyers, Journal of Retailing, 77, pp. 243-271, (2001); Badovick G.J., Beatty S.E., Shared Organizational Values: Measurement and Impact Upon Strategic Marketing Implementation, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 15, 1, pp. 19-26, (1987); Barnard C.I., The Functions of the Executive, (1968); Benckendorff P., Pearce P.L., The Psychology of Events, Handbook of Events, pp. 165-185, (2012); Bendapudi N., Berry L.L., Customers’ Motivations for Maintaining Relationships with Service Providers, Journal of Retailing, 73, pp. 15-37, (1997); Bianchi C., Arnold S.J., An Institutional Perspective on Retail Internationalization Success: Home Depot in Chile, International Review of Retail, Distribution, and Consumer Research, 14, pp. 149-169, (2004); Bliese P.D., Ployhart R.E., Growth Modeling Using Random Coefficient Models: Model Building, Testing, and Illustrations, Organizational Research Methods, 5, 4, pp. 362-387, (2002); Bowen H.E., Daniels M.J., Does the Music Matter?

Today they are commercialised offerings without the counter-cultural discourse of earlier times. Drawing on participant observation, interviews and focus groups conducted at a rock festival and a smaller boutique festival, the paper examines how their design, organisation and management are co-created with participants to produce authentic experiences. The paper contributes to research on authenticity in tourism by examining how authenticity emerges and is experienced in such co-created commercial settings. It presents the importance that the socio-spatial plays in authenticity experiences and how socio-spatial experience and engagement can also be recognised as a form of aura. © 2016 The Authors",aura;authenticity;co-creation;music festival;socio-spatial;festival;music;tourism,festival; music; tourism,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Anderton C., (Re) Constructing music festival places, (2006); Anderton C., Commercializing the carnivalesque: The V festival and image/risk management, Event Management, 12, pp. 39-51, (2008); Anderton C., Music festival sponsorship: Between commerce and carnival, Arts Marketing, 1, 2, pp. 145-158, (2011); Belhassen Y., Caton K., Steward W.P., The search for authenticity in the pilgrim experience, Annals of Tourism Research, 35, 3, pp. 668-689, (2008); Braun V., Clarke V., Successful qualitative research, (2013); Brown L., Tourism: A catalyst for existential authenticity, Annals of Tourism Research, 40, pp. 176-190, (2013); Buchmann A., Moore K., Fisher D., Experiencing film tourism: Authenticity and fellowship, Annals of Tourism Research, 37, 1, pp. 229-248, (2010); Cheong S.M., Miller M.L., Power and tourism.

However, determining what motivates volunteers, how they become satisfied, and how likely they are to continue volunteering at an event has been overlooked. This is especially true in reference to the music festival industry, which has seen unparalleled growth in the last decade. In order to further understand music festival volunteers, the concept of self-image was examined at the 2013 Austin City Limits Music Festival to determine linkages between self-image congruency and motivation, satisfaction, and intent to return using structural equation modeling. This music festival is of specific interest to the development of understanding the role of self-image in festivals and events due to the scale and size of the festival as well as the festival's requirement of being a local resident in order to volunteer. As such, the importance of understanding these local volunteers at a mega-event, which hosts 75,000 attendees per day over two 3-day weekends, is vital. This study found that self-image congruency has an impact on motivation, satisfaction, and intent to return and develops practical linkages and theoretical support for the consideration of self-image congruency when examining festival and event volunteers in a tourism context. © 2016 Cognizant, LLC.",austin city limits;mega-events;music festival;self-concept theory;volunteerism,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Anderson J., Gerbing D., Structural equation modeling in practice: A review and recommended two-step approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, 3, pp. 411-423, (1988); Bachman J.R., Backman K.F., Norman W.C., A segmentation of music volunteers at the 2013 Austin City Limits Music Festival: Insights and future directions, Journal of Convention&Event Tourism, 15, 4, pp. 298-315, (2014); Beerli A., Diaz G., Martin J., The behavioural consequences of self-congruency in volunteers, International Journal of Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Marketing, 9, 1, pp. 28-48, (2004); Bekkers R., Participation in voluntary associations: Relations with resources, personality, and political values, Political Psychology, 26, 3, pp. 439-454, (2005); Belk R., Possessions and the extended self, Journal of Consumer Research, 15, 2, pp. 139-168, (1988); Bendle L., Patterson I., Serious leisure, career volunteers and the organization of arts events in a regional Australian city, International Journal of Event Management Research, 4, 1, pp. 1-11, (2008); Bentler P., On the fit of models to covariances and methodology to the Bulletin, Psychological Bulletin, 112, pp. 400-404, (1992); Bentler P., Bonnett D., Significance tests and goodness of fit in the analysis of covariance structures, Psychological Bulletin, 88, pp. 588-606, (1980); Bowen H., Daniels M., Does the music matter?

Little research is apparent about the types of people, and their motivations, who attend these types of festivals. In addition, the research investigates the impact of military music festivals on the concepts of patriotism and national identity. Design/methodology/approach: The research approach involves empirical testing of a Canadian audience attending the Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo, a longstanding annual musical event held in Nova Scotia, Canada, that pays tribute to the country’s military heritage. A proposed classification model that includes two dimensions is applied, which investigates: motivation to attend the event and kinship to Canada’s military and naval traditions. Findings: Findings provide a better understanding of the diversity of the Canadian cultural tourist audience attending a military music display in terms of tourists’ demographics, experience of the show and the desire to return. This research also provides new insights as to the ability of a military musical event to arouse emotions of national pride, patriotism and strengthen national identity.

These commercial events, partnerships between event companies and shipping lines, celebrate a particular genre of music and occur aboard a cruise ship. The views of 138 festivalgoers primarily concentrated within six festivals were considered. According to these sources, the festival experience of these events is centred on three factors: live performances, interaction with fellow festivalgoers and star musicians (collectively referred to as ‘ship fam’), and interaction with the constructed space of the cruise ship. Cruise ship music festivals are a different type of music festival, still occurring within festival space, but within the mobile experiential cocoon of a cruise ship. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",cruise;experience;festival;music;sonic tourism,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Antoni R., ‘Blackbeard Doesn’t Come Here Anymore’, Outside, 24, 1, pp. 62-69, (1999); Arcodia C., Robb A., ‘A Future for Event Management: A Taxonomy of Event Management Terms’, pp. 154-160, (2000); Atkinson C.Z., ‘Whose New Orleans?

After a review of the relevant literature, an analysis was done of the responses of tourists who attended the 2013 World of Music, Arts, and Dance Festival in Cáceres, Spain. The fieldwork involved a personal interview survey carried out during the event, whereby 301 valid questionnaires were obtained, which were processed using a structural equations model and the partial least squares method. The results show how the brand positioning of a music festival can contribute to creating a positive destination image for participating tourists. The findings have significant implications for managers in terms of music festival tourism, such as the need to emphasize the destination as a unique event setting. © 2018 Cognizant, LLC.",event brand;loyalty;music festival;overall image;perception,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Andersson T.D., Getz D., Stakeholder management strategies of festivals, Journal of Convention & Event Tourism, 9, 3, pp. 199-220, (2008); Anderton C., Music festival sponsorship: Between commerce and carnival, Arts Marketing: An International Journal, 1, 2, pp. 145-158, (2011); Andreev P., Heart T., Maoz H., Pliskin N., Validating formative partial least squares (PLS) models: Methodological review and empirical illustration, Paper presented at the Thirtieth International Conference on Information Systems, (2009); Baloglu S., Dimensions of customer loyalty: Separating friends from well wishers, The Cornell Hotel and Restaurant Administration Quarterly, 43, 1, pp. 47-59, (2002); Baloglu S., Brinberg D., Affective images of tourism destinations, Journal of Travel Research, 35, 4, pp. 11-15, (1997); Baloglu S., McCleary K.W., A model of destination image formation, Annals of Tourism Research, 26, 4, pp. 868-897, (1999); Bigne J., Sanchez M., Sanchez J., Tourism image, evaluation variables and after purchase behaviour: Interrelationship, Tourism Management, 22, 2, pp. 607-616, (2001); Boo S., Busser J., Baloglu S., A model of customer-based brand equity and its application to multiple destinations, Tourism Management, 30, 2, pp. 219-231, (2009); Bowen H., Daniels M., Does the music matter?

Festivals and/or events promote a cultural exchange at international, national and local levels, with the opportunity for cultural sharing, from history and tradition, culinary and drinks, music and dance, involving all publics (organization, services, artists, participants and local inhabitants). Festivals are recognized as an effective strategy for host destinations promoting economic, social and cultural development. The present study aims to test the mediator role of quality and satisfaction in the relationship between the motivation in the choice of performing arts festivals and the loyalty of the tourists. The sample consisted of 532 respondents, collected at two performing arts festivals: Andanças festival (Portugal) and La Sierra festival (Spain). The results of the study show that tourists motivated to attend performing arts festivals, tend to perceive the festival as having quality, and are satisfied with the service, which in turn tend to revisit and recommend the festival. The study discusses the implications of the obtained results. It also presents limitations and suggests future studies. © 2019, Universidad de Huelva.

Notwithstanding the popularity of the festival, there has been no study of visitor intentions. Drawing upon the theory of planned behavior, this study aims to determine the effect of attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and past experience on behavioral intentions to attend the festival from the local visitor perspective. A questionnaire-based survey was administered using purposive sampling and ultimately 241 respondents participated. Multiple regressions analysis and t test were used to perform tests of relationship and difference. The findings show that although all the factors that are of interest have positive effects on intentions to visit the Festival, local visitors who have and have not attended previously exhibit very different behaviors. The study provides insights for the benefit of festival organizers and relevant stakeholders within the wider context of music festivals. © 2017 Cognizant, LLC.",intention;rainforest world music festival (rwmf);sarawak;theory of planned behavior (tpb);tourism,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Agaraj X., Murati M., Tourism an important sector of economy development, (2009);

It is widely acknowledged that interactions between tourists significantly influence behavioral reactions such as desire to stay, satisfaction, and loyalty, which are important for tourism destination marketing. This study used grounded theory to obtain insights into onsite interactions between tourists and to propose a conceptual model of TTI on the Midi Music Festival in China. The model constitutes the types, drivers, and influence of TTI. Compared with mutual assistance and conflict, entertainment interaction plays an essential role in the overall evaluation of the festival experience. Individual characteristics are the internal drivers of interactions between tourists. Environmental elements including the festivalscape and social festivalscape are influential exogenous factors. Additionally, spatial locations of tourists at the venue play mediating roles between the driving elements and TTI. Since entertainment incidents construct the essential part of onsite interactions at festivals, managers can shape the atmosphere to encourage tourists to engage in interactive entertainment with others tourists. This should improve participants' overall evaluations of the festival experience as well as the sustainable development of destinations where festivals are held. © 2019 by the authors.",festival tourism;interactions between tourists;tourism marketing;heritage tourism;marketing;sustainable development;tourist behavior;tourist destination,conceptual framework; heritage tourism; marketing; participatory approach; sustainable development; tourist behavior; tourist destination,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Martinez T.L., Toledo L.D., Faraoni N., Auditing Marketing and the Use of Social Media at Ski Resorts, Sustainability, 11, (2019); Bruwer J., Kelley K., Service performance quality evaluation and satisfaction in a USA wine festivalscape, Int.

Over 2000 different events are organized annually in Serbia, and music festivals are the most visited. One of them is EXIT festival. The EXIT festival is one of the biggest cultural and social projects running in Serbia based on the concept of modern European festivals. For the past eighteen years, Novi Sad has been hosting one of the largest, or even the largest international event in Serbia, which has attracted over 200,000 visitors, half of whom are foreign visitors. This study explored the relationships between the perceived quality of festival performance and experience factors (traffic and information, hygiene and safety, culture and art, socialization, infrastructure and products and services), behavioral intention and the overall visitor’s satisfaction intending to test a mediating role of the overall visitor’s satisfaction.

For that reason, before analysing the I Bienal Internacional de Música Contemporánea [1st International Biennial of Contemporary Music (I IBCM)], a synoptic comment is made on the most outstanding events that previously contributed to the commemoration of that event, namely, the First Opera Festival in Madrid, the Peace Concert, the Radio and Television (RTVE) Symphony Orchestra and the 1st Festival of Music of Americas and Spain (I FMAS), since all of them represented, in the field of music, the development of Spain in the 1960s and the type of integration with Europe that the pro-Franco technocracy attempted economically. It also explains the promotion of festivals as a phenomenon of early Francoism, begun during the opening decade of the 1950s in order to combat the diplomatic isolation of Spain, promote tourism and re-educate the Spaniards. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","contemporary music;festivals of spain;francoist technocracy;luis de pablo (1930-);madrid, 1964",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"(1965); Culture Section, Ministry of Information and Tourism.

The purpose of this study is to gain insights into the key determinants driving future intentions of travel consumers to participate in group-based travel to major events. An integrated theoretical model is empirically tested with 424 travel consumers who have had prior experience travelling in a group to a major event. The results substantiate the model showing that customer value perceptions of a past group-travel consumption experience conceptualised with multiple benefit dimensions has the largest relative effect on future intentions to engage in group-travel behaviour to major events, followed by attitude towards the host destination and enduring event involvement. The results provide managers with holistic insights into components that are used as the basis upon which group-travel consumers develop their choice behaviour which can be used to effectively cultivate more attendees to major events. © 2015, Westburn Publishers Ltd.",attitude towards the host destination;customer experience;perceived value;enduring involvement;group-travel behavior;major events;tourism marketing,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Regional visitor monitor-Quarterly focus: Leisure events (Benchmark Report prepared for Ministry of Economic Development), (2010); Ayeh J.K., Au N., Law R., Predicting the intention to use consumer-generated media for travel planning, Tourism Management, 35, pp. 132-143, (2013); Baloglu S., McCleary K., A model of destination image formation, Annals of Tourism Research, 26, 4, pp. 868-897, (1999); Bradley G., Sparks B., Antecedents and consequences of consumer value: A longitudinal study of timeshare owners, Journal of Travel Research, 51, 2, pp. 191-204, (2012); Byrd R.T., Beedle J., Cardenas D.A., Repeat visitation and visitor spending at events: Hogs and muscle cars, Event Management, 18, 2, pp. 101-110, (2014); Carlson J., O'Cass A., Creating commercially compelling website-service encounters: An examination of the effect of website-service interface performance components on flow experiences, Electronic Markets, 21, 4, pp. 237-253, (2011); Carlson J., O'Cass A., Optimizing the online channel in professional sport to create trusting and loyal consumers: The role of the professional sports team brand and service quality, Journal of Sport Management, 26, 6, pp. 463-478, (2012); Carneiro M., Crompton J., The influence of involvement, familiarity, and constraints on the search for information about destinations, Journal of Travel Research, 49, 4, pp. 451-470, (2010); Carroll B., Alexandris K., Perception of constraints and strength of motivation: Their relationship to recreational sport participation in Greece, Journal of Leisure Research, 29, 3, pp. 279-299, (1997); Chalip L., Green B., Hill B., Effects of sport event media on destination image and intention to visit, Journal of Sport Management, 17, 3, pp. 214-234, (2003); Chen T., Drennan J., Andrews L., Experience sharing, Journal of Marketing Management, 28, 13-14, pp. 1535-1552, (2012); Chen W., Perceived value of a community supported agriculture (CSA) working share.

Only one such study has been conducted in southern Africa to date. It is in a chronic shortage of research on tourism and climate change in the southern hemisphere. This study presents the application of the TCI in Lesotho, calculated for the eastern Lesotho Highlands. The region has an emerging tourism sector, which primarily comprises outdoor activities. These include hiking, horse-riding, music festivals, mountain biking, cultural visits, sightseeing, and at the Afriski lodge, skiing and snowboarding. These activities are reliant on climatic conditions that are conducive to the activity taking place, prolonged periods outdoors, and tourist satisfaction of the activity. Climate is a major determinant of both the length of season for these activities and the timing of peak tourist arrivals. Rising temperatures and changes in relative humidity and precipitation pose real threats to hiking, sightseeing and snow tourism at Afriski. The reliance of tourism in the region on specific climatic conditions for successful tourism prompted the use of the TCI. TCI results classify the eastern Lesotho Highlands as having ‘good’ climatic conditions with an overall TCI score of 64 for the period 2012–2017. Monthly TCI scores for the eastern Lesotho reveal a bimodal-shoulder, meaning the peak climatic conditions are in the regional summer months (December to February). This conflicts with the peak tourist seasons of summer and winter, which align with South African school holidays, and the timing of the most profitable tourism activity (skiing) which occurs during the winter months of June, July and August. Lesotho is landlocked by South Africa. TCI analysis for South Africa reveals more suitable climatic conditions for tourism than Lesotho, with significantly higher scores of 80–89. © 2019, Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",climate;lesotho highlands;outdoor tourism;snow tourism;tourism climatic index (tci);tourism market;tourist destination,Lesotho; Equidae; climate change; climate effect; outdoor recreation; precipitation (climatology); relative humidity; Southern Hemisphere; tourism market; tourist destination,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Tourist Attractions, (2018); Amelung B., Viner D., Mediterranean Tourism: exploring the future with the Tourism Climatic Index, Journal of Sustainable Tourism, 14, 4, pp. 349-366, (2006); Amelung B., Nicholls S., Viner D., Implications of Global Climate Change for Tourism Flows and Seasonality, Journal of Travel Research, 45, 3, pp. 285-296, (2007); Aylen J., Albertson K., Cavan G., The impact of weather and climate on tourist demand: the case of Chester Zoo, Climatic Change, 127, 2, pp. 183-197, (2014); Baral S., Adams D., Lebona J., Et al., A cross-sectional assessment of population demographics, HIV risks and human rights contexts among men who have sex with men in Lesotho, Journal of the International AIDS Society, 14, 1, pp. 36-44, (2011); Becken S., The importance of climate and weather for tourism: literature review, (2010); Blamey R.C., Kolusu S.R., Mahlalela P., Et al., The role of regional circulation features in regulating El Niño climate impacts over southern Africa: A comparison of the 2015/2016 drought with previous events, International Journal of Climatology, 38, 11, pp. 4276-4295, (2018); Bunakov O.A., Zaitseva N.A., Larionova A.A., Et al., Development Perspectives of “Last Chance Tourism” as One of the Directions of Ecological Tourism, Ekoloji Dergisi, 106, (2018); Cai W., Di H., Liu X., Estimation of the Spatial Suitability of Winter Tourism Destinations Based on Copula Functions, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 16, 2, (2019); Campos Rodrigues L., Freire-Gonzalez J., Gonzalez Puig A., Puig-Ventosa I., Climate Change Adaptation of Alpine Ski Tourism in Spain, Climate, 6, 2, pp. 29-41, (2018); Chi C., Qu H., Examining the structural relationships of destination image, tourist satisfaction and destination loyalty: An integrated approach, Tourism Management, 29, 4, pp. 624-636, (2008); de Freitas C.R., Scott D., McBoyle G., A second-generation Climate Index for Tourism (CIT): specification and verification, International Journal of Biometeorology, 52, 5, pp. 399-407, (2008); Demiroglu O.C., Dannevig H., Aall C., Climate change acknowledgement and responses of summer (glacier) ski visitors in Norway, Scandinavian Journal of Hospitality and Tourism, 18, 4, pp. 419-438, (2018); Dubois G., Ceron J., Gossling S., Hall C., Weather preferences of French tourists: lessons for climate change impact assessment, Climatic Change, 136, 2, pp. 339-351, (2016); Elsasser H., Burki R., Climate change as a threat to tourism in the Alps, Climate Research, 20, 3, pp. 253-257, (2002); Faturiyele I., Karletsos D., Ntene-Sealiete K., Et al., Access to HIV care and treatment for migrants between Lesotho and South Africa: a mixed methods study, Public Health, 18, 1, pp. 668-678, (2018); Fitchett J.M., Grant B., Hoogendoorn G., Climate change threats to two low-lying South African coastal towns: Risks and perceptions, South African Journal of Science, 112, 5-6, pp. 86-94, (2016); Fitchett J.M., Robinson D., Hoogendoorn G., Climate suitability for tourism in South Africa, Journal of Sustainable Tourism, 25, 6, pp. 851-867, (2017); Giaoutzi M., Tourism and regional development: New pathways, (2017); Giddy J.K., Environmental Values and Behaviours of Adventure Tourism Operators: The case of the Tsitsikamma, South Africa, African Journal of Hospitality, Tourism and Leisure, 5, 4, pp. 1-19, (2016); Giddy J.K., Webb N.L., Environmental attitudes and adventure tourism motivations, GeoJournal, 83, 2, pp. 275-287, (2018); Giddy J.K., Fitchett J.M., Hoogendoorn G., Insight into American tourists’ experiences with weather in South Africa, Bulletin of Geography.

The sample consisted of 498 respondents (women = 44. 7%), with 230 Americans (women = 50%), and 268 South Africans (women = 40. 3%). They completed online surveys on brand trust and loyalty of the festival event. Structural equation modelling showed the festival event performance enhanced brand trust and loyalty. Additionally, higher festival event brand trust and loyalty reciprocally enhanced each other. Further, American tourists had little evidence of festival event performance influences on their brand loyalty, while South African tourists had a strong festival performance and brand loyalty association. The results are consistent with the view that festival performances self-market with brand trust and loyalty influences on consumers, while the selling points may vary based on audience segment. © 2020 Africa Scholarship Development Enterprize.",bangtan sonyeondan;loyalty;brand trust;global viewer;korean dance;melon music awards,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Aluri A., Price B.S., McIntyre N.H., Using machine learning to cocreate value through dynamic customer engagement in a brand loyalty program, Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research (Washington, D.C), 43, 1, pp. 78-100, (2019); Casteran G., Chrysochou P., Meyer-Waarden L., Brand loyalty evolution and the impact of category characteristics, Marketing Letters, 30, 1, pp. 57-73, (2019); Cha H., Kim S., A study on K-POP strategy: Focused on digital music environment and social media, International Information Institute (Tokyo).

Yet relevant studies have so far overlooked how these events can themselves serve as experiments in less resource consumptive living. Building on a wider interest in the cultural evolution of cleanliness norms, this paper explores how attendees come to use water in personal washing at two UK festivals. Through survey, observation and interview research, it examines how current festival goers respond to the disruption of their usual washing regimes, paying particular attention to how a combination of social and infrastructural cues serves to encourage the emergence of a temporary new cleanliness culture. Doing so highlights the value of seeing human resource consumption as a matter of dynamic collective convention more than fixed personal preference since these respondents were seen to embrace a new relationship with washing that was otherwise deemed unthinkable. This leads to a broader discussion of how visitor needs and the social world are most usefully studied by both future festival organisers and the wider field of sustainable tourism research. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",cleanliness;festival;social norms;water consumption;united kingdom;ecotourism;music,United Kingdom; ecotourism; festival; music; summer; water use,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Abubakar I., Gautret P., Brunette G.W., Blumberg L., Johnson D., Poumerol G., Khan A., Global perspectives for prevention of infectious diseases associated with mass gatherings, The Lancet Infectious Diseases, 12, pp. 66-74, (2012); Andersen J., The music festival–Communicative recognition with a political aspect, Paper presented at the 7th ECPR General Conference, Sciences Po, (2013); Anderton C., Commercialising the carnivalesque: The V festival and image/risk management, Event Management, 12, pp. 39-51, (2008); Bowen H., Daniels M., Does the music matter?

The purpose of this exploratory research was to cluster Generation Y concertgoers to various concerts held in South Africa during 2012 and 2013 based on their age to identify and profile different market segments at the concerts. Data were collected at eight live music performances, during 2012 and 2013, by performers Linkin Park, Adam Lambert, Celtic Woman, Lady Gaga, Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Bon Jovi, Justin Bieber and Rodriguez. This resulted in a total factor analysis conducted to identify the main motives of Generation Yers to attend live music performances. Generation Yers were then divided into three groups based on their age in order to give a better idea of the differences among these concertgoers. Three Generation Y clusters were identified, namely, Tweens, Twixters and Tweeds. Analyses of variance, two-way frequency tables and χ2 tests showed significant differences between the segments in terms of socio-demographic and behavioural characteristics as well as motives. Based on the results, it is evident that generation theory needs to be taken into consideration, and it can be a useful tool to segment markets. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.",generation theory;generation y;live music performances;south africa,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Aldskogius H., Festivals and meets: the place of music in ‘Summer Sweden’, Geografiska Annaler, 75B, 2, pp. 55-72, (1993); Bausch S., McGiboney M., Social networks and blogs now 4th most popular online activity, ahead of personal email.

This was done by using visitors’ behavioural intentions related to these benefits as a tool for market segmentation. Design/methodology/approach: The research followed a quantitative approach by conducting a visitor survey at an international jazz festival in South Africa. Findings: The results showed that visitors’ post-festival behavioural intentions are a useful market segmentation tool. This approach revealed three distinct market segments with different levels of post-festival behavioural intentions (high, medium, and low). The results further showed that music festivals have the potential to create benefits beyond the festival itself or the host destination in the form of music tourism and the appreciation of a music genre. However, influencing visitors’ behavioural intentions can only be achieved by a thorough understanding of the characteristics of the market. Originality/value: This research applied an innovative market segmentation approach that showed the post-festival behavioural intentions of different visitor segments at a music festival. The findings confirm that music festivals can have far-reaching benefits that can contribute to their legacy. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",behavioral intentions;market segmentation;music appreciation;music festival;music tourism,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Arts and culture, (2015);

In the new digital era of marketing communications little is known about how social media interactions with tourism brands affect how consumers think and feel about those brands, and consequently how those interactions affect desired marketing outcomes such as word mouth. Based on the literature, a conceptual model was developed and was tested using structural equation modeling. The results show that social media does indeed have a significant influence on emotions and attachments to festival brands, and that social media-based relationships lead to desired outcomes such as positive word of mouth. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",brand relationship quality;emotions;marketing;music festival;social media;music;tourism management,empirical analysis; marketing; music; tourism management,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Aaker D.A., Building strong brands, (1996); Addis M., Holbrook M.B., On the conceptual link between mass customization and experiential consumption: an explosion of subjectivity, Journal of Consumer Behavior, 1, 1, pp. 50-66, (2001); Algesheimer R., Dholakia U.M., Herrmann A., The social influence of brand community, Journal of Marketing, 69, 3, pp. 19-34, (2005); Bagozzi R.P., Gopinath M., Nyer P.U., The role of emotions in marketing, Academy of Marketing Science Journal, 27, 2, pp. 184-206, (1999); Bartneck C., Croft E., Kulic D., Measuring the anthropomorphism, animacy, likeability, perceived intelligence and perceived safety of robots, Proceedings of the metrics for human-robot interaction workshop in affiliation with the 3rd ACM/IEEE international conference on human-robot interaction (HRI 2008), pp. 37-44, (2008); Belk R.W., Possessions and the extended self, Journal of Consumer Research, 15, 2, pp. 139-168, (1988); Blackston M., Beyond brand personality: building brand relationships, Brand equity and advertising: Advertising's role in building strong brands, pp. 113-124, (1993); Bornstein R.F., Exposure and effect: overview and meta-analysis of research, Psychological Bulletin, 106, 2, pp. 265-289, (1989); Bowden J., Customer engagement: a framework for assessing customer-brand relationships: the case of the restaurant industry, Journal of Hospitality Marketing & Management, 18, 6, pp. 574-596, (2009); Campbell R.B., Asense of place: Examining music-based tourism and its implications in destination venue placement, (2011); Chappuis B., Gaffey B., Parvizi P., Are your customers becoming digital junkies?, McKinsey Quarterly, (2011); Clark N., How emotion can sell your brand, Marketing, (2009); The comScore 2010 mobile year in review; Connell J., Gibson C., Sound tracks: Popular music, identity and place, (2003); Crosby L., Johnson S., Experience required, Marketing Management, 16, 4, pp. 20-28, (2007); Cruz B., Mendelsohn J., Why social media matters to your business, Chadwick Martin Bailey, (2010); Damasio A.R., Descartes' error, (1994); Damasio A.R., The feeling of what happens, (2000); Damasio A.R., Looking for spinosa, (2003); d'Astous A., Colbert F., d'Astous E., The personality of cultural festivals: scale development and applications, International Journal of Arts Management, 8, 2, pp. 14-23, (2006); Dholakia U.M., Durham E., One café chain's Facebook experiment, Harvard Business Review, 88, 3, (2010); Dillon W.R., Goldstein M., Multivariate analysis methods and applications, (1984); Edelman D., Branding in the digital age, Harvard Business Review, 88, 12, pp. 62-69, (2010); Ekinci Y., Yoon T.-H., Oppewal H., An examination of the brand relationship quality scale in the evaluation of restaurant brands, Advances in hospitality and leisure, 1, pp. 189-197, (2005); Fournier S., Aconsumer-brand relationship framework for strategic brand management, (1994); Fournier S., Consumers and their brands: developing relationship theory on consumer research, Journal of Consumer Research, 24, 4, pp. 343-373, (1998); Gibson C., Connell J., Music and tourism: On the road again, (2007); Haslam C., Do music festivals contribute to local tourism?, Tourism Insights, (2009); Heath R., The hidden power of advertising, (2001); Heath R., Brandt D., Nairn A., Brand relationships: strengthened by emotion, weakened by attention, Journal of Advertising Research, 46, 4, pp. 410-419, (2006); Hoffman D.L., Fodor M., Can you measure the ROI of your social media marketing?, MIT Sloan Management Review, 52, 1, pp. 41-49, (2010); Hudson S., Hudson R., Engaging with consumers using social media: a case study of music festivals, Journal of Events and Festivals Management, 4, 3, pp. 206-223, (2013); Kaplan A.M., Haenlein M., Users of the world, unite!

Festivals serve as cultural celebrations for the locals and international tourists who wish to look into the local culture. The concept of sustain-ability has crossed boundaries from its original environmental issues into tourism and festivals. As a means towards ensuring festivals remain a core rather than a peripheral leisure activity for both locals and international attendees, this study aimed at comparing the motives and perception of festival impacts for the two groups. A self-administered questionnaire was used in collecting data during the annual Sauti za Busara music festival in Zanzibar. Chi-square and f-tests were used to ascertain group differences where motivation to attend the festival indicated significant differences between locals and international attendees. Both groups of attendees indicated to have positive perception of the festival impacts onto the economic, environment, and socioculture. The results have policy and management implications that can aid festival stakeholders to make the festivals sustainable. © 2016 Cognizant, LLC.",attendees;festival;motives;sustainability;zanzibar,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Abreu-Novais M., Arcodia C., Music festival motivators for attendance: Developing an agenda for research, International Journal of Event Management Research, 8, 1, pp. 34-47, (2013); Addo P.A., Anthropology, festival, and spectacle, Reviews in Anthropology, 38, 2, pp. 217-236, (2009); Andersson T.D., Lundberg E., Commensurability and sustainability: Triple impact assessment of a tourism event, Tourism Management, 37, pp. 99-109, (2013); Anwar S.A., Sohail S.M., Festival tourism in United Arab Emirates: First-time versus repeat visitor perceptions, Journal of Vacation Marketing, 10, 2, pp. 161-170, (2004); Bagiran D., Kurgun H., A research on social impacts of the Foca Rock festival: The validity of the festival social impact attitude scale, Current Issues in Tourism, 19, 9, pp. 930-948, (2013); Bayrak G.O., Festival motivators and consequences: A case of Efes Pilsen Blues Festival, Turkey, Anatolia: An International Journal of Tourism and Hospitality Research, 22, 3, pp. 378-389, (2011); Bgoya L., Kapambwe M., 7 African music festivals you really have to see, (2014); Bowdin G.A.J., Allen J., O'Toole W., Harris R., McDonnell I., Events management, (2006); Bowen H.E., Daniels M.J., Does the music matter?

However, research on the complex relationship between festival brand metrics and visitor attendance is limited. This relationship is particularly relevant to local governments, tourism boards, and festival organizers because, without reach and visitors, regional branding and identity building are likely to fall on deaf ears. Using data collected from 136 Dutch music festivals, as well as hierarchical regression analysis, this study confirms that a balancing act is necessary with respect to brand popularity, brand similarity, and brand diversity and that being too unique as a festival brand can become a double-edged sword. This finding is particularly relevant because many festival organizers often highlight innovativeness and uniqueness in their requests for funding, regional marketing support, and community engagement. The implications for festival organizers, destination marketers, and local governments are discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",brand diversity;branding;music festival,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Aaker D.A., Managing brand equity: Capitalizing on the value of a brand name, (1991); Aaker D.A., Joachimstahler E., Brand leadership, (2000); Marketing definitions: A glossary of marketing terms, (1960); Arcodia C., Whitford M., Festival attendance and the development of social capital, Journal of Convention and Event Tourism, 8, 2, pp. 1-18, (2006); Balmer J.M.T., Gray E.R., Corporate brands: What are they?

The Network for the Preservation of Intangible Cultural Heritage was formed in 2012. Of the twenty-seven proposals submitted, six representative elements of ICH that reflect the ethnic cultural identity of the Serbian nation were initially chosen: The feasts for patron-saints, the St. George's Day ritual, a folklore dance called kolo, singing with the gusle, flute playing and rug making in Pirot. These elements play an important role in the creation of national identity and have the potential to become significant for tourism in Serbia.

Unlike previous studies this research is unique in that it integrates social cognitive theory (SCT) which is usually found in psychology discourses. The purpose of this paper is to propose how the Motivation-Opportunity-Ability (MOA) model would benefit from integrating self and group efficacy theory. It achieves this by building on previous analysis of primary data collected in the field at the Utcazene, Street Music Festival, Veszprem, Hungary, (Jepsonet al., 2013) using an adapted MOA model.; Design/methodology/approach– This paper analyses previous studies which have tested the MOA model through primary data collection. Following this analysis best practice is and similarities are identified through discussion; then a case is then made to adapt the model to integrate and test Bandura’s (1986) concept of self-efficacy based on the benefits it could provide to future research within community festivals and events.; Findings– This paper has been framed by initial research by Jepsonet al.(2013) and Hung et al. (2011) which after analysis revealed that the MOA model was still lacking in its ability to reveal “why” local people were motivated or empowered to engage in the planning of community festivals and events. It has become evident through discussion that measuring self-efficacy has much to contribute in regards to community engagement in the event planning process; moreover there is strong evidence to support its inclusion within the MOA model. It could be used to further inform on the synergy within and between the three disciplines underpinning the model such as the relationship between knowledge, opportunity and ability, as well as reveal new ones between self-efficacy and knowledge, opportunity and ability.; Research limitations/implications– This is a conceptual paper and therefore is based on theoretical discussion but not on empirical data collected in the field of event studies.; Originality/value– Very few studies have engaged measurement of community participation within festivals and events. This study is original as it is interdisciplinary and investigates the concerns the roles local community take (as stakeholders), meanings (how local community culture is represented within the festival) and impacts (internal and external festival impacts and how these effect the local community) through established planning frameworks and SCT. © 2014, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",community engagement;community festivals and events;moa model;self-efficacy;social cognitive theory (sct);tourism,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Aas C., Ladkin A., Fletcher J., Stakeholder collaboration and heritage management, Annals of Tourism Research, 32, 1, pp. 28-48, (2005);

Marketing communications controlled by the organization are considered a fundamental antecedent of brand equity. However, the impact on brand equity of traditional and online communications created by and communications external to an organization have been studied separately in the literature and to the best of our knowledge no works have jointly analyzed various communication instruments controlled by and external to a company in the area of event tourism. This study therefore aimed to analyze the influence of brand communications controlled and not controlled by the organization on forming brand equity for an event and to estimate the impact of overall brand equity on satisfaction and behavioral intentions of attendees of the event. Focusing on the main live music festival in Spain and with a sample of 622 attendees, evidence was obtained on the effectiveness of using brand communications on the event to generate brand equity that will help to inform decisions of managers of live music festivals regarding investment in instruments for communicating the event. © 2018 Cognizant, LLC.",branding;marketing communications;musical festival,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Aaker D.A., Managing brand equity, (1991); Aaker D., Measuring brand equity across products and markets, California Management Review, 38, 3, pp. 102-120, (1996); Ababio A.G., Yamoah E.E., Effect of Advertising on the brand loyalty of cosmetic products among college students, (2016); Adjei M.T., Noble S.M., Noble C.H., The influence of C2C communications in online brand communities on customer purchase behavior, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 38, 5, pp. 634-653, (2010); Ahluwalia R., Burnkrant R.E., Unnava H.R., Consumer response to negative publicity: The moderating role of commitment, Journal of Marketing Research, 37, 2, pp. 203-214, (2000); Ailawadi K., Lehmann D., Neslin S., Revenue premium as an outcome measure of brand equity, Journal of Marketing, 67, 4, pp. 1-17, (2003); Akdeniz B., Calantone R.J., Voorhees C.M., Effectiveness of marketing cues on consumer perceptions of quality: The moderating roles of brand reputation and third-party information, Psychology & Marketing, 30, 1, pp. 76-89, (2013); Anderson E.W., Fornell C., Lehmann D.R., Customer satisfaction, market share, and profitability: Findings from Sweden, Journal of Marketing, 58, 3, pp. 53-66, (1994); Anderson J.C., Narus J.A., A model of distribution firm and manufacturer firm working partnerships, Journal of Marketing, 54, pp. 42-58, (1990); Anil N.K., Festival visitors' satisfaction and loyalty: An example of small, local, and municipality organized festival, Tourism, 60, 3, pp. 255-271, (2012); El 78% de los asistentes a festivales de música acudirán a 2 o más citas este año, (2016); Ataman M.B., Van Heerde H.J., Mela C.F., The long-term effect of marketing strategy on brand sales, Journal of Marketing Research, 47, 5, pp. 866-882, (2010); Atilgan E., Aksoy S., Akinci S., Determinants of the brand equity, Marketing Intelligence & Planning, 23, 3, pp. 237-248, (2005); Bagozzi R.P., Yi Y., On the evaluation of structural equation models, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 16, 1, pp. 74-94, (1988); Bailey R., Ball S., An exploration of the meanings of hotel brand equity, The Service Industries Journal, 26, 1, pp. 15-38, (2006); Barreda A.A., Bilgihan A., Nusair K., Okumus F., Generating brand awareness in online social networks, Computers in Human Behavior, 50, pp. 600-609, (2015); Baumol U., Hollebeek L., Jung R., Dynamics of customer interaction on social media platforms, Electronic Markets, 26, 3, pp. 199-202, (2016); Berry L.L., Cultivating service brand equity, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 28, 1, pp. 128-137, (2000); Berthon P., Pitt L.F., Campbell C., Does brand meaning exist in similarity or singularity?, Journal of Business Research, 62, 3, pp. 356-361, (2009); Biel A.L., How brand image drives brand equity, Journal of Advertising Research, 32, 6, pp. 6-12, (1992); Bonhomme J., Christodoulides G., Jevons C., The impact of user-generated content on consumer-based brand equity, 6th Thought Leaders Conference on Brand Management, 61, pp. 1-16, (2010); Boo S., Busser J., Baloglu S., A model of customer-based brand equity and its application to multiple destinations, Tourism Management, 30, 2, pp. 219-231, (2009); Bravo Gil R., Fraj Andres E., Martinez Salinas E., Family as a source of consumer-based brand equity, Journal of Product & Brand Management, 16, 3, pp. 188-199, (2007); Brodie R.J., Ilic A., Juric B., Hollebeek L., Consumer engagement in a virtual brand community: An exploratory analysis, Journal of Business Research, 66, 1, pp. 105-114, (2013); Brodie R.J., Whittome J.R., Brush G.J., Investigating the service brand: A customer value perspective, Journal of Business Research, 62, 3, pp. 345-355, (2009); Brown S., Marketing to millennials: Improving relationships with millennial consumers through online advertising and social media networking, (2016); Bruhn M., Schoenmueller V., Schafer D.B., Are social media replacing traditional media in terms of brand equity creation?, Management Research Review, 35, 9, pp. 770-790, (2012); Buil I., De Chernatony L., Martinez E., Examining the role of advertising and sales promotions in brand equity creation, Journal of Business Research, 66, 1, pp. 115-122, (2013); Buil I., Martinez E., De Chernatony L., The influence of brand equity on consumer responses, Journal of Consumer Marketing, 30, 1, pp. 62-74, (2013); Camarero C., Garrido M.J., Vicente E., Components of art exhibition brand equity for internal and external visitors, Tourism Management, 31, 4, pp. 495-504, (2010); Cameron G.T., Does publicity outperform advertising?

Performances of culture in tourist settings are often viewed as inauthentic, staged purely for the benefit of tourists. This article contests this enduring perspective, best known through the notion of ‘staged authenticity’. Drawing on research conducted in the diasporic Pacific festival space in New Zealand, this article focuses on how those from within Pacific communities view their performances. Giving agency to the actors allows them to define performances and festivals from an emic perspective, and this challenges the notion of staged authenticity. Rather than material performed purely for the festival and its cultural tourists, performances instead represent a movement of material from largely homogenous community contexts into the multicultural public sphere. Furthermore, the notion of nonlinear temporal relations shows how these performance traditions function contemporaneously, as an important component of the community repertoires from which they come. This in particular challenges the idea that touristic performances represent ‘staged authenticity’. Rather, traditional musics represent one way in which diasporic Pacific communities authentically stage themselves. © 2016 Discipline of Anthropology and Sociology, The University of Western Australia.",festivalisation;new zealand;pasifika;staged authenticity;traditional music,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Alexeyeff K., Dancing from the Heart: Movement, Gender, and Cook Islands Globalization, (2009); Balme C., Staging the Pacific: Framing Authenticity in Performances for Tourists at the Polynesian Cultural Centre, Theatre Journal, 50, 1, pp. 53-70, (1998); Bendrups D., Pacific Festivals as Dynamic Contact Zones, Shima: The International Journal of Research into Island Cultures, 2, 1, pp. 14-28, (2008); Bossen C., Festival Mania, Tourism and Nation Building in Fiji: The Case of the Hibiscus Festival, 1956–1970, The Contemporary Pacific, 12, 1, pp. 123-154, (2000); Bowlman P., The Study of Folk Music in the Modern World, (1988); Brown P., New Caledonia: A Pacific Island or an Island in the Pacific?

This is the case with what is often called “trance” as it travels in the global market: it is made into a fetish, treated as an object with transformative powers, ultimately becoming a form of symbolic capital that helps create the category of the “sacred” in a transnational context. In this article I focus on one example of such fetishization ‒ The Essaouira Gnawa Festival of World Music in Morocco. Emphasizing the “universality” of music, international music festivals like the one in Essaouira construct a notion of the sacred for audiences who come faithfully and perennially from great distances to “trance out” to the music. © 2020, Universite Mohammed V de Rabat - Institut Scientifique.

However, contradictory place theory has created confusion as to exactly what these mechanisms are and how they affect perceived environment. Literature identifies place attachment and place identity as primary mechanisms in the construction of tourist relationships with tourist environments. An interpretive methodology is used to explore these mechanisms during a festival experience, and thematically analyzed unstructured interviews show identity and attachment do influence attendees' place-based perceptions. Within the festival context, environments become either creations of the festival or exist independently of them. The latter allows realistic place identity to form, resulting in consonance between environmental expectations and reality. The former creates abstract identities resulting in unrealistic expectations and weak/no immediate attachment to the festival environment. A Model of Festival Place provides continuity-based festival recommendations allowing for clearer theoretical and practical understanding across tourism events. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",music festival;place attachment;place identity;tourist environment;festival;sense of place;tourism management;tourist attraction,festival;

For them, the classical tourist attractions are not satisfying and interesting anymore. The aim of the paper is to examine experience factors based on models from the literature review and understand the internal connections among the experience dimensions in the case of music festivals in Hungary. Design / Methodology / Approach - For testing the suggested model based on the literature review and previous researches, a quantitative primary research was conducted. A structured questionnaire was used focusing on five factors of experience economy in case of Hungarian music festivals. The data was collected by an online survey via LimeSurvey, and PLS-SEM path analysis was used to interpret the acquired data. Findings - As a result of the quantitative research significant connection appear among the five experience factors in the field of festivals like other previous researches suggested in other fields. Education, entertainment and escapism experience can be built on aesthetics and economic value - the fifth experience factor - can be built on these four factors. Originality of the research - Knowing how experience factors are based on each other and how they can influence each other is an important factor for festival managers to create an optimal and balanced mix of experience for visitors. By achieving this memorable experience and long lasting memories of the event can be reached. © 2020 University of Rijeka.

The origin, temporal magnitudes, potential risks and mass inputs of emerging contaminants (ECs) were investigated. Thirty targeted ECs were analyzed by solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS/MS). Sampling strategy was designed to characterize EC behavior in different stages (before and after the youth festival), based on multivariate data analysis to explore the contributions of contaminants from normal condition to the youth festival. Wastewater in fluents and effluents were collected during the youth festival (approximately 600 000 pop music fans and youth participated). Surrounding river waters are also sampled to illustrate the touristic impacts during peak season and off-season. Seasonal variations were observed, with the highest concentrations in April (Spring Scream) and the lowest in October (off-season). Acetaminophen, diclofenac, codeine, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin-H2O, and gemfibrozil have significant pollution risk quotients (RQs > 1), indicating ecotoxicological concerns. Principal component analysis (PCA) and weekly patterns provide a perspective in assessing the touristic impacts and address the dramatic changes in visitor population and drug consumption. The highest mass loads discharged into the aquatic ecosystem corresponded to illicit drugs/controlled substances such as ketamine and MDMA, indicating the high consumption of ecstasy during Spring Scream.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on a visitor survey at the oldest EDM festival in South Africa, namely, H2O, five motives for attending H2O were identified (fun and dance; novelty; excitement, group identity and entertainment; lifestyle and well-being; and travel and escape), while the results revealed three clusters of EDM festival visitors: enthusiasts, energizers and electros. The results demonstrated that clustering EDM festival visitors based on their motives is a useful market segmentation tool as it yields a clear and direct profile and understanding of different types of attendees and their preferences. Findings: The results as well as findings emphasize how EDM events can play a role in expanding tourism, especially youth travel, by hosting more EDM festivals in the country. Originality/value: The study proposes a 3E typology of EDM festival visitors that could be applied to other EDM festival and event markets. This research, therefore, makes a clear contribution to the literature on EDM festivals and events and the market that this distinct music genre attracts. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",electronic dance music festival;market segmentation;motives;south africa;typology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Beaver A., A Dictionary of Travel and Tourism Terminology, (2005); Bowen H.E., Daniels M.J., Does the music matter?

Called the ‘Getty of the Antipodes’, the museum mounts a permanent collection, special exhibitions and music/art festivals intended to shock conventional moral sensibilities. Yet, the conservative people of the community embrace their purposefully provocative attraction for having put them on the world map. This article raises a number of questions. Does creating an attraction and the arrival of tourists change local thought and practice in any fundamental ways? Or is it all a masquerade for the golden horde? Is understanding one’s own locality as an attraction-for-others changing the locals’ perception of where and how they live? And of one another?

In the literature, few studies have examined the impact of sound sources on old buildings. In this study, two types of ignimbrite from the Cappadocia region, fossiliferous limestone used in historical Ottoman buildings, mudstone from the Kula Geopark area, and sandstone used in historic buildings in Erzurum were tested at different sound levels to determine the effect of noise on the rock samples. A new laboratory test setup was developed for noise-effect testing. The rock samples were placed in the sound-test cabinet and exposed to sound levels of 80–130 dB at 1–1200 min duration. Changes in the sonic velocity, porosity, water absorption by weight, and uniaxial compressive strengths of the samples were measured, as well as the deformation caused by the sound waves on the surface of the samples.

Each corner of India is unique and different from the other when it comes to food, music, dances, festivals, weather, ecology, flora and fauna, and so forth. India offers a totally distinct tourism experience with its diverse geography and cultures. The present research paper mainly evaluated the need of marketing of India as a tourism destination. The research paper briefly lists the major promotional schemes of the Government of India and examines the performance of the Indian tourism industry in comparison with other major countries of the world (in general) and Asia-pacific (in particular). The study finally concludes that the marketing and promotional efforts have resulted in improved performance of the tourism industry in India. However, India is still unable to utilize its full tourism potential and needs to put in more rigorous efforts for tourism promotion as well as marketing. © 2014, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

It presents the historical background of the development of tourism in Arillas, the actions that have been undertaken by the local stakeholders to actively participate in the management of the village and to attract alternative, responsible and sustainable forms of tourism to Arillas, and the main players contributing to this process, as well as a look at three important themes contributing to the change. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on an empirical study spanning many years by a local inhabitant who has an affinity with place management and marketing. It also includes some conclusions of a quantitative, questionnaire-based customer satisfaction survey carried out in 2011 and 2012 among 600 visitors. The analysis of the quantitative data was carried out by the Head of the Corfu Department of the National Tourism Organisation of Greece. Findings: The paper demonstrates how a shared vision, combined with empowerment and communication among local stakeholders on improving the place, as well as many joint actions carried out on a volunteer basis have, first of all, dramatically increased the level of engagement of the locals in the present and future of Arillas, and second they have attracted and are attracting more individual travellers who are coming for the hospitality, local food and products, music and cultural festivals, walking, yoga and meditation rather than the outdated mass tourism model. Research limitations/implications: It would be very interesting to perform another quantitative, questionnaire-based survey now to compare the results to those of 2012. Originality/value: This paper demonstrates that a bottom-up, horizontal approach to placemaking and place marketing can yield substantial results even (or especially) in an adverse economical and social environment. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",alternative tourism;bottom-up placemaking;corfu;greece;placemaking;responsible placemaking,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Skinner H., The future of tourism in Corfu: initial research, reporting, and beyond, pp. 20-22, (2014)","A.

The principal aim was to construct a new conceptual framework that may help scholars, practitioners and policy makers make sense of dynamic patterns of illegal drug use across bounded play spaces such as tourist resorts, music festivals and nightclubs. Methods: Ethnographic fieldwork employing a grounded theory design was undertaken over three summers in tourist locations on the Balearic island of Ibiza, including nightclubs, bars, cafes, beaches, airports and hotels. Field notes from participant observation were supplemented with data from semi-structured interviews (n = 56) and secondary sources gathered from tourist marketing. Results: The framework of Disneyization has been discussed in terms of 5 constructs: theming, hybrid consumption, branding, performative labour and atmospheres; each having a specific role in relation to understanding illicit drug use in bounded play spaces. Thus: Theming sets the stage, by physically and symbolically demarcating space with indelible themes of hedonism that open up the possibility of illicit drug use. Hybrid-consumption blurs the distinction between legal and illegal forms of intoxication, making the trading and consumption of illegal drugs appear like a natural feature of the consumer space. Branding demonstrates how participants construct intricate hierarchies of taste and credibility related to drug of choice. Performative labour re-enforces hybrid consumption, with participants working in the bounded play spaces of Ibiza immersed within the illicit drug market. Atmospheres represents the alchemic synergy of bounded play space and is important to understanding illicit drug use as a sensorial, deeply immersive but transitory experience.

This article is based on interviews with, among others, recording artists, promoters, producers and venue managers, along with reflective observational and documentary data.

The aim was to discover whether a music festival brings additional intangible benefits. The research followed a quantitative approach by conducting a visitor survey at the Cape Town International Jazz Festival in South Africa. Structural Equation Modelling showed that music festivals have the potential to create benefits beyond the festival itself or the host destination, particularly fostering an appreciation of a music genre, increasing purchasing of music, and boosting music tourism. The findings showed that a music festival could have far-reaching benefits that can contribute to its legacy. It also showed that visitors’ motives have a unique relationship with their behavioural intentions, which emphasizes the need to market the festival accordingly. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",behavioral intentions;cape town international jazz festival;music appreciation;music festival motivation;music tourism;structural equation modelling;south africa;festival;music;perception;tourism;tourism market;tourist destination,Cape Town; South Africa; Western Cape; festival; modeling; music; perception; tourism; tourism market; tourist destination,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Arts and culture, (2015); Ajzen I., Fishbein M., Belief, attitude, intention and behavior: An introduction to theory and research, (1975); Ajzen I., Fishbein M., Attitude-behavior relations: A theoretical analysis and review of empirical research, Psychological Bulletin, 84, 5, pp. 888-918, (1977); South Africa: 16th Cape Town International Jazz Festival first artist line-up announcement, (2014); Bennett A., Peterson R.A., Introducing music scenes, Music scenes: Local, translocal, and virtual, pp. 1-16, (2004); Blunch N.J., Introduction to structural equation modelling using SPSS and AMOS, (2008); Chang S., Gibson H., Sisson L., The loyalty process of residents and tourists in the festival context, Current Issues in Tourism, 17, 9, pp. 783-799, (2014); Chen C.F., Tsai D., How destination image and evaluative factors affect behavioral intentions?, Tourism Management, 28, 4, pp. 1115-1122, (2007); Chhabra D., Student motivations: A heritage tourism perspective, Anatolia, 21, 2, pp. 249-269, (2010); Clark L.A., Watson D., Constructing validity: Basic issues in objective scale development, Psychological Assessment, 7, 3, pp. 309-319, (1995); Cohen J., Cohen P., West S.G., Aiken L.S., Applied multiple regression/correlation analysis for the behavioral sciences, (2013); Crompton J.L., Motivations for pleasure vacation, Annals of Tourism Research, 6, 4, pp. 408-424, (1979); Cronin J.J., Brady M.K., Hult G.T.M., Assessing the effects of quality, value, and customer satisfaction on consumer behavioral intentions in service environments, Journal of Retailing, 76, 2, pp. 193-218, (2000); Dancer T., Jazz festivals and intangible heritage.

Increasing attention has been paid to the music–tourism relationship and this paper seeks to elaborate upon the contested meanings and dimensions of Celtic music in the wake of its commodification through tourism. Attention is accorded to the interlocking tensions relating to commodification and authenticity within music and tourism studies and, moreover, the role of emotion within the authenticity and music debate. Drawing upon empirical research conducted at a Celtic music festival (Glasgow, Scotland) comprising in-depth interviews and a questionnaire survey, it is suggested the festival audience attach authenticity to the music on the basis of their emotional interaction with the music. This occurs by the ways in which emotion is evoked within the music and the relationship between music, emotion and audience identities. © 2008 C.M.

This paper provides just such a valuation, using economic impact analysis conducted on surveys of visitor and organiser spending at the 2009 Cape Town International Jazz Festival. On the basis of the survey data and event budget, a social accounting matrix (SAM) for the Western Cape Province was used to estimate the economic value of the festival to the province's economy (using the classic SAM's multiplier approach).

Such a perception is largely thanks to festival organizers and local merchants, who provide fans with an illusion of locality through performances of intimacy within the theatrical spaces of Helenaâ€™s backstage areas. In this article, I illustrate the importance of a perceived and performed locality in the realization of both the fan experience and the annual festival. Through such inclusive experiences, fans move beyond the role of spectator and, in their assumption of true fandom, encounter a heightened blues experience, take on the role of the local culture, and become a vital part of Helenaâ€™s multifaceted blues tradition. Through such fan performances, Helena and its blues tradition are revived, ensuring the success of the festival, the survival of its host city, and a continued theatrical space for performances of individuality, community, tradition, and â€œtrueâ€ fandom. © 2013, SAGE Publications.

It highlights the processes through which Scottish song traditions have moved from being everyday, unremarkable practice to public spectacle and tourism performance. An historically grounded analysis of contemporary folk festivals and events in Aberdeenshire demonstrates how the content of folksong has become ever more fixed at the same time as performances have been re-signified to represent the region to both locals and tourists. The paper also traces out the processes of the spectacularization of tradition and the movement of individual songs from agricultural landscapes, through field, archive, and edited collection to contemporary folk festival and public display. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

It is an opportune goal because even though this region is experiencing an important increase of new festivals and cultural events, there is a lack of adequate coordinating and guiding tourism policies. Design/methodology/approach The data was gathered with a survey to managers of music festivals that provided information about their management structure and economic results. The study findings are the result of an analysis done with a statistical multivariate technique and constructing indicators of event economic feasibility and tourism specialisation. Findings Data reveals the coexistence of two different types of festivals in Catalonia depending on their cultural or touristic orientation and with clear differences in their management style. Both types have a professionalized management structure and an economic selfsufficiency when compared with the rest of Catalan cultural events, so they can be considered as an asset for regional tourism development. Nevertheless, some problems are detected in management practices that should be improved when implementing a specific tourism event policy. Originality/value The research has built a unique event data base that can be useful for decision making in tourism public administration. The paper suggests that local and regional administration should consider music festivals and cultural events, in general, as excellent resources to create new tourism products. Some of the characteristics of festivals, such as their important potential as tourism attractions and their cultural identity or the economical success, are critical assets to their high potential in local tourism development. These findings should justify a more resolute public policy of events and music festivals in Catalonia. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",culture;festival;music;regional development;spain,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Anton S., Catalunya enfront els nous hàbits, (2001); Getz D., Event Management and Event Tourism, (1997); Getz D., Why festivals fail?, Event Management, 7, pp. 209-219, (2002); Getz D., Event Studies, Theory, Research and Policy for Planned Events, (2007); Getz D., Event tourism: definition, evolution and research, Tourism Management, 29, pp. 403-428, (2008); Gonzalez F., Tourism in Catalonia.

Music tourism is a rapidly expanding and diverse tourist niche, although rarely acknowledged by geographers or tourism scholars. The article discusses historical precedents, before sketching a typology of contemporary linkages between music, tourism and place, including museums and festivals, sites of birth and death and (musical) creation, and locations enshrined in lyrics. Prior research is reviewed and new approaches proposed based on an understanding of place as both sensuously experienced (constructed via a 'tourist ear'), and mediated by racializations of various sorts. Recognition of the contribution of music tourism to the cultural economy of cities is also emphasized. A diversity of methodologies is advocated for more comprehensive studies of the links between music, tourism and place. A case study of Memphis highlights such diversity. It demonstrates how music shapes tourist space both aurally and physically, how notions of racial and local identity are invoked, and how music tourism contributes to the building of new kinds of economic and cultural networks.",african-american tourism;cultural economy;memphis;music tourism;racialization;sensory geography;the tourist ear;music;place name;tourism;typology,Memphis; North America; Tennessee; United States; African American; cultural economy; music; place name; racial identity; tourism; typology,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Alderman D., Writing on the Graceland wall: On the importance of authorship in pilgrimage landscapes, Tourism Recreation Research, 27, 1, pp. 27-33, (2002); Atkinson C., Shakin' your butt for the tourist': Music's role in the identification and selling of New Orleans, Dixie Debates: Perspectives on Southern Cultures, pp. 150-164, (1996); Attali J., Noise: The Political Economy of Music, (1992); Beeton S., Film Induced Tourism, (2005); Brabazon T., From Penny Lane to Dollar Drive: Liverpool tourism and Beatle-led recovery, Public History Review, 2, pp. 108-124, (1993); Brennan-Horley C., Gibson C., Connell J., The Parkes Elvis Revival Festival.

Whilst there has been considerable research in sustainable tourism including Craig-Smith (1994,1996), Main (1989), Fagence (1997) and Tisdell and McKnee (1988), there has been limited research undertaken in relation to event tourism on remote islands. It is fair to say that remote communities face a raft of problems in developing a sustainable industry base (Dowling 1999), however, these problems are not insolvable. As demonstrated by tourism development in larger island groups including Hawaii (Craig-Smith 1996), remote islands have the potential to host many successful events every year. Often events and festivals provide a means for communities and visitors to experience and share what is unique to a particular destination or region. This interaction with host and visitor allows visitors to experience the local way of life, music, foods and the culture of the island residents. In essence this 'sense of place' is often the product or commodity which ultimately becomes the destination marketing message. Thus the tourism industry and community alike, brand the commodity as a means of marketing the destination. The islands chosen for this case study are Espiritu Santo and Tangoa. These islands are approximately one hour by small aircraft north of the main islands of Efate and form part of the Republic of Vanuatu. Whilst Vanuatu has been marketed as 'the islands lost in time' there is now a need to enhance the tourism experience for visitors and this may be accomplished by event tourism. The study sought to investigate perceptions of the local residents towards tourists. It also sought to ascertain their needs whilst visiting Espiritu Santo and Tangoa. Through analysis of the responses provided in the questionnaires, a number of key concerns were identified that may well impact on the future of event tourism on Espiritu Santo and the near offshore island of Tangoa. These issues are discussed and suggestions put forward as to how they might adequately be addressed. © 2002 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,14775085,NA,NA,NA,English,J.

Successful management of these CSFs will ensure that major music events retain satisfied visitors and remain competitive over the long term. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",critical success factors;event management;events tourism;factor analysis;music tourism;neil diamond;visitor experience,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Aldskogius H., Festivals and meets: The place of music in 'Summer Sweden, Geografiska Annaler, 75 B, 2, pp. 55-72, (1993); Allen J., O'Toole W., Harris R., McDonnell I., Festival & special event management,, (2008); Appel C., Kruger M., Saayman M., Critical success factors in managing hotels in South Africa, (2010); Berridge G., Event design and experience, (2007); Berry L.L., Carbone L.P., Haeckel S.H., Managing the total customer experience, MIT Sloan Management Reviews, 43, 3, pp. 85-89, (1992); Neil Diamond live for the first time ever in South Africa, (2010); Bitner M.J., Serviscapes: The impact of physical surroundings on customers and employees, Journal of Marketing, 56, 1, pp. 57-71, (1992); Bowdin G., Allen J., O'Toole W., Harris R., McDonnell I., Event management, (2006); Brotherton B., Shaw J., Towards an identification and classification of critical success factors in UK hotels plc, International Journal of Hospitality Management, 1, 15, pp. 113-135, (1996); Brown M.D., Var T., Lee S., Messina hot wine and jazz festival: An economic impact analysis, Tourism Economics, 8, 3, pp. 273-279, (2002); Clark L.A., Watson D., Constructing validity: Basic issues in objective scale development, Psychological Assessment, 7, 3, pp. 309-319, (1995); Deighton J., The consumption of performance, Journal of Consumer Research, 19, 1, pp. 362-372, (1992); de Witt L., Key success factors for managing special events: The case of wedding tourism, (2006); Dickinson R.A., Ferguson C.R., Sircar S., Critical success factors and small business, American Journal of Small Business, 8, 3, pp. 49-57, (1984); Earl P.E., Simon's travel theorem and the demand for live music, Journal of Economic Psychology, 22, 3, pp. 335-358, (2001); Erasmus L.J., Key success factors in managing the visitors' experience at the Klein Karoo National Arts Festival, (2011); Field A., Discovering statistics using SPSS, (2005); Getz D., Event tourism: Definition, evolution, and research, Tourism management, 29, 1, (2008); Hausman A., Attribute satisfaction and experiential involvement in evaluations of live musical performance: Theory and managerial implications for services, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 18, 1, pp. 210-217, (2011); Israel G.D., University of Florida IFAS Extension.

This view implies the significance of experiences of individual satisfaction with a given product or visit. To assess this assumption, we have made use of Pine and Gilmore's widely known model, and in so doing have empirically examined the applicability of their concept of an ""experience economy"" and its four dimensions (education, escapism, esthetics, and entertainment). The necessary data were collected from two tourism contexts, the Ice Music Festival and the Maihaugen Museum. The results indicate that Pine and Gilmore's model can further our understanding of the experience market. However, the findings show that different experiential dimensions influence the visitors' overall satisfaction in different contexts. For instance, while the dimension of escapism has a significant effect on the visitors' overall satisfaction in the case of the Ice Music Festival, the dimension of education significantly influences the visitors' satisfaction at the Maihaugen Museum. The theoretical and practical implications of this study are also discussed. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",experience economy;experiences;pine and gilmore;satisfaction,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Binkhorst E., Dekker T.D., Agenda for co-creation tourism experience research, Journal of Hospitality Marketing & Management, 18, pp. 311-327, (2009); Bitner M.J., Servicescapes: The impact of physical surroundings on customers and employees, Journal of Marketing, 56, 2, pp. 57-71, (1992); Boswijk A., Thijssen T., Peelen E., The experience economy: A new perspective, (2007); Cool K., Dierickx I., Jemison D., Business strategy, market structure and risk-return relationships: A structural approach, Strategic Management Journal, 10, 6, pp. 507-522, (1989); Flagestad A., Opplevelsesøkonomien på vei, Magma, 9, 3, pp. 81-90, (2006); Gilmore J.H., Pine B., Differentiating hospitality operations via experiences: Why selling services is not enough, Cornell Hotel and Restaurant Administration Quarterly, 43, 3, pp. 87-96, (2002); Goffmann E., The presentation of self in everyday life, (1959); Grove S.J., Fisk R.P., The impact of other customers on service experiences: A critical incident examination of ""getting along., Journal of Retailing, 73, 1, pp. 63-85, (1997); Heide M., Gronhaug K., Atmosphere: Conceptual issues and implications for hospitality management, Scandinavian Journal of hospitality and Tourism, 6, 4, pp. 271-286, (2006); Hightower R., Brady M.K., Baker T.L., Investigating the role of the physical environment in hedonic service consumption: An exploratory of sporting events, Journal of Business Research, 55, pp. 697-707, (2002); Opplevelsesøkonomi i Hovedstad-regionen.

Design/methodology/approach – Video-ethnography is an emerging research technique in marketing academe. The technique derives from the ethnographic tradition in anthropology and incorporates a blend of participant observer and thick description interview techniques. The video evidence does not replace field notes. Rather the video evidence contributes strongly to an edited deliverable that complements and in some instances substitutes for a traditional manuscript. Findings – Participants spend hundreds, sometimes thousands of dollars purchasing a week of music classes, concerts and jam sessions located in campus-like venues, often rural and remote and without many of the comforts of home. Three strong themes emerged from the observations and interviews. Consumer immersion in a musical enclave for a week to develop their musicianship is the first theme. The second theme intertwines the third: a sense of the liminoid in which a personal transition or transformation occurs; and the emergence of communitas, in which community ties strengthen as a consequence of experiencing these transitions within a group. Practical implications – The video ethnography is remarkable because music camp organizers forbid filming. Indeed, for the first time in the history of this music camp (of 16 years standing at the time of the research), filming occurred in the camp. After a while, the presence of the researcher videographer appeared to go unnoticed by participants, arguably becoming an integral part of the music camp experience. Originality/value – Little research has been done about the consumption of music camps. This written and audio-visual ethnography addresses this gap in knowledge. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",communitas;community;ethnography;experiential consumption;liminal phenomena;music;popular culture;tourism;video,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Arnould E.J., Price L.L., River magic: extraordinary experience and the extended service encounter, Journal of Consumer Research, 20, June, pp. 24-45, (1993); Arnould E.J., Wallendorf M., Market-oriented ethnography: interpretation building and marketing strategy formulation, Journal of Marketing Research, 31, November, pp. 484-504, (1994); Belk R.W., Kozinets R.V., Videography in marketing and consumer research, Qualitative Market Research, 8, 2, pp. 128-141, (2005); Hearn F., Communitas and reflexive social theory, Qualitative Sociology, 3, 4, pp. 299-322, (1980); Kamau L.J., Liminality, communitas, charisma, and community, Intentional Community, pp. 17-40, (2002); Lyons K., Dionigi R., Transcending emotional community: a qualitative examination of older adults and masters' sports participation, Leisure Sciences, 29, pp. 379-389, (2007); Turner V., The Ritual Process, Structure and Anti-Structure, (1969); Turner V., Variations on a theme of liminality, Secular Ritual, pp. 36-52, (1977)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,17506182,NA,NA,NA,English,Int.

Augmenting the literature on lesbian tourism, the article deploys a conceptualisation of festivals, such as gay pride, that seeks to contest dominant codes and norms as parties with politics. Using the data gathered from 222 qualitative questions, 10 interviews and 1 focus group, it explores the intertwining of music, feminist politics and temporality in understanding womyn’s motivations in attending a separatist festival. Distinctively, it demonstrates how barriers to, and motivations for, attending festivals can be paradoxically mutually formative. In this way, it becomes possible both to question tick-box motivational frameworks and to explore festival times and spaces as (re)making tourist encounters. Thus, the article opens up considerations and theorisations of festival attendee’ motivations looking to the complexities of experiences, motivations and time–space interactions. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Many of these festivals were established during a mid-twentieth-century period of diminishing Old World identity among second and third generation immigrants. The celebrations sought not only to revive ethnic identification by highlighting customs such as cuisine, music and dance, but also to boost the local economy by tapping into a burgeoning tourism destination market. Wilber, Nebraska, home to a large population of Czech Americans, resurrected such a festival in 1962 that had not been celebrated since 1937, and this paper explores a number of geographical, historical, cultural and political factors contributing to its initial and continued popularity as a regional ethnic festival. Also discussed are the commodified cultural items, including food, polka music, craftwork and traditional clothing that provide Czech Americans a means to engage in and maintain a satisfying level of ethnic identity without exerting significant amounts of money and time. The Czech Festival continues to benefit Wilber economically with tens of thousands of tourist visits each year, and surveys indicate that the maintenance of ethnic customs and identity in the community is increasingly becoming dependent on the festival. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",cultural commoditization;czech americans;ethnic identity;festival;heritage tourism;nebraska;symbolic ethnicity,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Adams J., German for a day?

The setting of the Mediterranean viewed from the land's edge gave the world theoria, which Greek etymology and usage associates with looking onto a scene with amazement, viewing drama, being sent as an emissary to consult the oracle, or traveling for the purposes of sightseeing. The present essay explores some connections between the Mediterranean and theoria. Following a brief survey of how theoria functioned in antiquity, it studies the case of 20th-century Greek poet Angelos Sikelianos and American director and choreographer Eva Palmer - husband and wife - who sought to revive ancient ideas of theoria. They organized revivals of the Delphic Festivals in 1927 and 1930 as a prelude to re-establishing Delphi as a world center for people with a vision for the world. Their work rivaled that of the Olympic Revivals, except that the Delphic Revival was linked to a particular Mediterranean site and pursued the course of art, music, social thought, and especially tragedy together with athletics. A spectacular, imaginative, ambitious, but stillborn effort, it gives evidence of both the potential and limits of Mediterranean theoria. © 2001, SAGE Publications.

Foreigners contribute to the economic disparities that characterise Sosrowijayan, but their influence on the relative status and autonomy of women there is more difficult to discern. Based on ethnographic research, this article posits an interpretation of gender relations in Sosrowijayan by, firstly, modifying Bourdieu's concept of the habitus, and then seeking to locate this in a comparative analysis of sexualised behaviours at musical events in Yogyakarta's commercial establishments and kampung. The article concludes that Javanist, westernised and quasi-Islamic sensibilities each contribute to the sexualisation of musical performances in these settings, thereby highlighting some of the difficulties of equating specific cultural influences with gender relations and everyday body language in and around Sosrowijayan.",cultural influence;cultural tradition;music,Asia; Eurasia; Indonesia; Southeast Asia; Yogyakarta; autonomy; comparative study; cultural influence; cultural tradition; gender relations; music,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Asmussen V., Constructing gender and local morality: Exchange practices in a Javanese village, Indonesia and the Malay World, 32, 94, pp. 315-329, (2004); Beatty A., Varieties of Javanese Religion: An Anthropological Account, (1999); Beazley H., Street boys in Yogyakarta: Social and spatial exclusion in the public spaces of the city, A Companion to the City, (2000); Bourdieu P., Outline of a Theory of Practice, (1977); Bourdieu P., Wacquant L., An Invitation to Reflexive Sociology, (1992); Cowan J., Dance and the Body Politic in Northern Greece, (1990); Dahles H., Tourism, Heritage and National Culture in Java: Dilemmas of a Local Community, (2001); Dahles H., Bras K., Entrepreneurs in romance: Tourism in Indonesia, Annals of Tourism Research, 26, 2, pp. 267-293, (1999); Statistik Pariwisata Tahun 2000.

Events that can generate tourism income, spur the transformation of event cities into cities of culture, and help reinforce a city’s brand have also been used to reinvent so-called post-industrial difficult areas. This downtown tourism and entertainment strategy has been utilized in Detroit, the best-known difficult area in the US. This paper examines the sports and music components of Detroit’s plan to address economic and social challenges stemming from deindustrialization, disinvestment, and decentralization. To foster economic growth and improve the city’s persistently poor image, Detroit has redeveloped its downtown into an entertainment district anchored by two sports stadia and focused on landing sports mega events. This development, which mirrors that undertaken by other cities, is part of its long-term strategy for dealing with blight and its image problems. Detroit also has belatedly focused on events celebrating its musical heritage. Specifically the Detroit Electronic Music Festival (DEMF), which centers on techno, an alternative musical form born in the city and intertwined with its post-industrial cultural identity, has been used in differentiating and branding Detroit. The DEMF attracts an international audience and can thus help promote an image of post-Fordist Detroit as creative and cosmopolitan, rather than economically and socially paralyzed. Finally, this paper examines how Detroit’s newest destination branding strategy incorporates, both the traditional and alternative, in its focus on cars, culture, gaming, music and sports and sells post-Fordist Detroit as cool, cutting edge, and real. © 2008 Tourism Recreation Research.",destination branding;detroit;mega events;music tourism;sport tourism;tourist bubbles;tourist entertainment districts,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Aglietia M., A Theory of Capitalist Regulation., (1979); Aguilar L., Host Cities May Not Reap Super Spoils; Big Garnes Don’t Mean Big Profits, The Detroit News, (2004); Aguilar L., Harmonie Park Plans Get a Boost; Downtown Development Authority Commits $10M Toward a Proposed African-American Cultural District, (2007); Ashworth G.J., Voogd H., Selling the City: Marketing Approaches in Public Sector Urban Planning., (1990); Atkinson C.Z., Whose New Orleans?

Design/methodology/approach – The paper examines literature on music and cultural tourism as well as government reports. Semi-structured interviews were done with a cross-section of people, key to the development of musical cultural tourism on Cape Breton Island. Findings – The paper reports on the initial investments of the federal government of Canada in tourism infrastructure on Cape Breton Island in the 1970s and the initial investments in entertainment as a component of tourism in 1986. The paper examines the growth of Celtic music in Cape Breton and the birth of the success of the Cape Breton sound. Research limitations/implications – The practitioners of the music industry are quite clear in their views of the importance of their sector to the broader tourism industry. However, the study is quiet on the actual perceptions and views of the tourist. Further research should examine the importance of the cultural experience in contributing to the satisfaction of the visitors' experience. Practical implications – The success of the Celtic Colors International Festival has clearly indicated the market for Cape Breton Celtic music and that festivals of this sort have the ability to extend the tourism season. Originality/value – The paper chronicles the development of one of the most successful Atlantic Canadian cultural tourism products which has broad applications in comparable tourist destinations. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",culture;diversification;economics;entertainment,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Aldskogius H., Festivals and Meets: The Place of Music in ‘Summer Sweden’, Geografiska Annaler.

A comparative methodology for the study of events tourism is outlined and the results are presented in two stages; firstly, by means an element-by-element comparison of each of the characteristics; secondly, by way of a summary matrix. This comparative analysis emphasises the heterogeneity of the demand for events. While some similarities are found, especially between the two food and beverage festivals, the general picture to emerge from the findings is one of difference. Event-goers do not appear to constitute a single homogeneous market; rather, different events appear to attract different audiences. The implications of these findings are discussed and suggestions for further research are outlined. © Henry Stewart Publications, 1356-7667.",comparative research;events;festival;market segmentation;profile characteristics;visitor surveys,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Special events: Defining the product, Tourism Management, 10, 2, pp. 125-137, (1989); Festivals, Special Events and Tourism, (1991); Hallmark Tourist Events: Impacts, Management & Planning, (1992); Some macroscale growth trends in America's community festival industry, Festival Management and Event Tourism, 2, 1, pp. 10-14, (1994); The effects of group membership and motivation on attendance: An international festival case, Tourism Analysis, 3, 3-4, pp. 197-207, (1998); An examination of event motivations: A case study, Festival Management and Event Tourism, 1, 1, pp. 5-10, (1993); An investigation of festival motivations and events satisfaction by visitor type, Festival Management and Event Tourism, 1, 3, pp. 89-97, (1993); Tourism Research: Critiques and Challenges, pp. 113-134, (1993); Themes and issues in comparative destination research: The use of lesson-drawing in comparative tourism research in the North Atlantic, Tourism Management, 20, 5, pp. 627-633, (1999); Comparative Research Methods, pp. 3-41, (1973); Unobtrusive observational measures as a qualitative extension of visitor surveys at festivals and events: Mass observation revisited, Journal of Travel Research, 35, 4, pp. 25-30, (1997); Nicholson R.E., Visitor Experience and Special Events: A Comparative Analysis of Special Event Tourism in the South Island, (1998); Non-consumptive wildlife-oriented recreation (NCWOR): A conceptual framework, Biological Conservation, 53, 3, pp. 213-231, (1990); A market segmentation of festival visitors: Umbria Jazz Festival in Italy, Festival Management and Event Tourism, 3, pp. 175-182, (1996); Characteristics of the audience for ""events"" at a heritage site, Tourism Management, 17, 3, pp. 183-190, (1996); An examination of event tourism motivations and activities; Motives of visitors attending festival events, Annals of Tourism Research, 24, 2, pp. 425-439, (1997); Smith, The Festival Visitor: It may not be who you think it is, (1988); Heritage tourism on the West Coast of New Zealand, Tourism Management, 17, 3, pp. 203-212, (1996); Wilson P.M., Commercial Wildlife Viewing Tourism in the South Island: A Comparative Analysis, (1993); Tourism Marketing and Management Handbook, pp. 341-344, (1989)",NA,NA,SAGE Publications Ltd,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,13567667,NA,NA,NA,English,J.

Whereas the literature has emphasized the need to incorporate stakeholders into the management of festivals, researchers have not considered how these stakeholders are segmenting their attendees. This article applies a stakeholder approach to attendee segmentation through the utilization of a case study approach with semistructured interviews to profile visitors to Easterfest, an Australian Christian music festival. The results suggest that stakeholders, although not actively segmenting visitors, share many similarities in their description of the characteristics and behavioral patterns of attendees to the festival.

Since its inception in 2000, attendance figures have increased from the initial 14,000 to 32,000 in the past 9 years. The festival's winning formula of bringing more than 40 international and local artists to perform over 2 days on five stages has earned it the status of being the most prestigious event on the African continent. The festival is furthermore currently ranked as the number four jazz festival in the world; even outshining events such as Switzerland's Montreux Festival and the North Sea Jazz Festival in Holland. A research survey was done for the first time at the festival in 2009 where 432 visitor questionnaires were completed, and a second survey was conducted during the festival in April 2010 where 420 questionnaires were administered. The aim of this research is to segment visitors to the Cape Town International Jazz Festival based on the frequency of visits to distinguish between first-time and repeat festival attendees. Both first-time and repeat visitor groups play a fundamental role in the overall well-being and success of a festival and festival organizers must strive to achieve a balance between first-time and repeat visitors. Therefore, festival organizers should be aware of the festival attributes that differentiate between the first-time visitor group and repeat visitors attending the festival. Two-way frequency tables and chi-square tests as well as ANOVAs and Tukey's multiple comparisons were used to analyze the data and segment firsttime and repeat visitors based on sociodemographics, behavioral characteristics, and overall satisfaction and travel motivations. These differences should be considered when the festival program is designed and marketed. The latter will greatly contribute to the long-term sustainability of the festival. © 2013 Cognizant Comm.

The goal of this work is to estimate the economic value allocated by tourists and local residents to a classical music festival in the emblematic city of Santiago de Compostela (Spain). The contingent valuation method is used to ascertain whether there are any significant differences between the value declared and to study the sensitivity of the findings in a range of socio-economic variables.

This study aimed to explore the leisure and tourist behaviours of serious, and at times fanatical, participants at the Wintersun Festival in Queensland, Australia. The weeklong nostalgic celebration of music, dancing, cars and lifestyles attracts participants from distant communities to travel and participate in the activities that are integral to achieving their leisure goals. This study utilised participant observation to identify nine domains which describe and explain the behaviours of participants including specialised travel, lifestyle, identity reinforcement, pride, fanaticism, social interaction, fixated consumption, competition and skill development. The results highlight the specialised travel experience undertaken by participants and the important role of events in fulfilling their personal and social goals.",event;serious leisure participants;travel;festival;tourist behavior,Australasia;

There is a growing recognition of this sector's value and economic role, resulting in it becoming an industry in its own right. Investigating attendee motivations therefore becomes an increasing priority for event organizers and tourism organizations generally. Event organizers can improve the various components of their events through the understanding of attendee's motivations. The last decade has witnessed an increase in literature focusing on visitor motivations when attending events. However, there have been very few studies into visitor motivations when attending cultural events, particularly within the context of Scotland. Traditional Scottish music events are a fundamental part of Scotland's culture. This, coupled with the identification of cultural tourism as having ""very good prospects"" as a niche market for Scotland (www.scotexchange.net), further highlights the need for such a study. Thus, the aim of this study is to examine visitor motivations when attending traditional Scottish music events. Initially, a focus group was held to probe and discuss attendance motivations and to investigate views on the linkages between such events and the Scottish tourism industry. A questionnaire, comprising 15 motivational items represented on a 7-point Likert scale, was then distributed to members of two traditional Scottish music associations. The resulting data (based on a total sample of 110 respondents) were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software. A hierarchical cluster analysis was carried out to identify groups of respondents with similar motivations when attending traditional Scottish music events. Key findings include a ranked list of visitor motivations and four discrete groups resulting from the cluster analysis. These groups were identified and labeled according to their dominant characteristics: ""Modernists,"" ""Family and Inspiration Seekers,"" ""Social Pleasure Seekers,"" and ""Thrill Seekers."" The article expands on these key results, focusing on a discussion of the dominant characteristics within each of fhe four cluster groups. The article also discusses respondents' views on the linkages between traditional Scottish music events and their role within the Scottish tourism product and cultural tourism. The majority of respondents do believe there is an association between traditional Scottish music events and Scottish tourism; however, debate emerges regarding the quality and range of events available to visitors to Scotland. This exploratory study provides cultural music event organizers with a greater understanding of visitor motivations and characteristics within the context of Scotland by breaking the visitors down into distinct motivational groups. This research adds to the body of literature in the area of visitor motivations when attending events, specifically cultural and music events. This work also contributes to the body of research that has utilized cluster analysis as a segmentation tool. Further research will be recommended in relation to the cluster groups and the portfolio of events currently available as part of the Scottish tourism product. Copyright © 2007 Cognizant Comm.

The aim is to achieve commensurability. The proposed model is tested on a three-day music festival and the results demonstrate a possibility to produce a sustainability impact analysis in a uniform metric. Measured in monetary terms, socio-cultural impacts carry weight just as economic impacts do whereas environmental impacts have little importance for the total assessment. This illustrates how the low market value of emission rights make environmental concerns negligible from an economic perspective. Finally, issues related to scope of the assessment, commensurability and opportunity cost are discussed and possibilities for future studies are suggested. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",cba;economic impact;event;non-use value;sustainability;sweden;tourism;willingness to pay;tourism development,Sweden;

Despite the growing consumption trend of group-oriented travel behavior and the economic significance of large-scale, event-based tourism, a theoretical gap exists in understanding what drives potential attendees' desire to attend these events, particularly in groups. A theoretically developed conceptual model is empirically tested using survey data from 170 Australian respondents planning to attend, and travel in a group, to a major social event. The results support the model showing that travel motivations (configured as a Type II multidimensional model), affective destination image, and enduring involvement in the event category influence group-oriented travel behavior to major events. Managerial implications and recommendations for future research are also presented. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",destination image;event-based tourism;group-travel behavior;involvement;travel motivation,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Regional visitor monitor-Quarterly focus: Leisure events, (2010);

What is their part in creating transnational communities of affect? In this article, I theorize what I call ""the promise of sonic translation"": the trust in the ultimate translatability of aural (as opposed to textual) codes. This promise, I assert, produces the ""festive sacred,"" a configuration of aesthetic and embodied practices associated with festivity wherein people of different religions and nations create and cohabit an experience of the sacred through heightened attention to auditory and sense-based modes of devotion conceived as ""universal."" The festive sacred is a transnational (thus mobile) phenomenon inextricable from the enterprise of sacred tourism. Such festive forms not only produce a Turnerian communitas but also create new transnational categories that mediate religious sentiment and reenchant the world. © 2008 by the American Anthropological Association.

The theoretical foundation was related to internationalization processes, internationalization of services, international events, and music festival tourism. The analysis covered a critical case, namely, Kuhmo Chamber Music Festival, during its history of 35 years. The empirical findings indicated that the internationalization process evolved through the following four phases: ""local chamber music festival,"" ""domestic chamber music festival,""; ""internationally enlarged chamber music festival,"" and ""maturing international chamber music festival."" The managerial implications are that the key actors' international orientation is the core when achieving concrete results in internationalization. © 2008 by The Haworth Press.

Rich in that the teacher has a variety of options, colourful in that the student will be engaged by the language and content. Design/methodology/approach - The case study focuses on an unusual and relatively new leisure product that combines two growing areas: cruise tourism and music festivals. The case is written in a narrative style to allow student interpretation of the material and application to a range of marketing concepts. The information within the case is derived from a number of published sources including market data, internet chatrooms, blogs and an interview with a customer. Findings - The case builds to provide a picture of an innovative niche product in an emerging growth market. In the introduction, it demonstrates that popular music is no longer limited to low-income youth. The sections that follow the introduction set the scene for a (variable) market definition. Next, the experiences revealed in the Sixthman Blog show their lack of understanding of this ""new product"". Whilst, the personal experience that follows highlights typical customer demographics and needs. The research from Mintel pulls much of this together before leaving some thoughts for the future in the final section. Originality/value - The case can be used for teaching in a number of ways, for example, relating to market development, segmentation, targeting and marketing communications. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",leisure activities;leisure facilities;music;ships;travel,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"A different kind of cruisin' 4 February 2008, Sixthman, (2008); Cockcroft L., Eagles fans forced to pay £1,000 per ticket, The Daily Telegraph, (2007); Croughton P., Posh camping at Britain's music festivals, The Times, (2008); Hecht R.B., I always like to go places I have never been, Out Traveller, (2008); I'm so encouraged! 7 February 2008, Sixthman, (2008); Cruises UK 2007, (2007); If I had a boat... 7 February 2008, Sixthman, (2008); Russia's Medvedev meets Deep Purple, USA Today, (2008)","S.

The impacts are calculated on output, demand and wages, employment and on national and regional taxes. The results indicate, first, that the effects of the festival on output are about €1.7 million. Kaustinen can also be seen as a good investment for the local municipality, as regional tax revenues increased by about €65,600 in the year studied, while the annual subsidy was €40,365. From the perspective of the Keski-Pohjanmaa region as a whole, the Kaustinen Folk Music Festival has a substantial impact on regional incomes through subsidies (about one-fifth of the costs of the festival is offset by subsidies from the Arts Council of Finland (Ilmonen et al, 1995) and the direct and indirect effects of consumption by festival visitors in different economic sectors. The impact on employment in the region is low (27 employees). The mobilization of voluntary labour, not measured in this study, is, however, considerable. Although the input-output method is laborious and statistically complex, it is very suitable for measuring the impact of tourism or cultural events on local economies. The method provides results that can be used in framing regional policy.",economic impacts;input-output analysis;music festival;cultural heritage;economic impact;music;tourist attraction,cultural heritage; economic impact; input-output analysis; music; tourist attraction,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Bohlin M., Ternhag G., Festivalpublik Och Samhälsekonomi- En Studie Av Falun Folk Music Festival, (1990); Flegg A.T., Webber C.D., Elliott M.V., On the appropriate use of location quotients in generating regional input-output tables, Regional Studies, 29, 6, pp. 547-561, (1995); Gratton C., Taylor P., Economic impact study: Hayfield International Jazz Festival, Leisure Management, 3, pp. 19-21, (1986); Ilmonen K., Kaipainen J., Tohmo T., Kunta Ja Musiikkijuhlat, (1995); Miller R.E., Blair P.D., Input-Output Analysis: Foundations and Extensions, (1985); Miyazawa K., Input-Output Analysis and the Structure of Income Distribution, (1976); Myerscough J., The Economic Importance of the Arts in Britain, (1988); Porter M.E., The Competitive Advantage of Nations, (1989); Richardson H.W., Input-Output and Regional Economics, (1972); Richardson H.W., Regional Economics, Location Theory, Urban Structure and Regional Change, (1972); Smith P., Morrison W.I., Simulating the Urban Economy: Input - Output Techniques, (1974); Corporate Enterprises and Personal Business in Finland 1995, (1997); Regional Input-Output 1995: Tables and Complication Methods, (2000); Tohmo T., New developments in the use of location quotients to estimate regional input-output coefficients and multipliers, Regional Studies, 38, 1, pp. 43-54, (2004)","T.

There is increased emphasis on achieving sustainability in event management; some festivals, particularly large outdoor music festivals, are leading in greening their events. This paper explores the drivers of, and barriers to, greening festivals and considers how events might be a vehicle for promoting sustainable behaviour. The application of the Mair and Jago model is tested. Long interviews were conducted with managers of six UK and Australian festivals that have won awards for their ""green"" performance and an organisation that encourages the greening of festivals. Findings suggest that managers of these festivals act both as a champion and a steward of greening and that the key drivers of festival greening are the personal values or ethos of the manager and/or the organisation, demand for greening from stakeholders and a desire to educate and act as an advocate of green issues. Barriers to greening festivals included the financial costs, lack of time and control over festival venues and the inability to source appropriate suppliers or supplies. Further research could explore these issues in other events contexts and examine whether events leave a lasting legacy in terms of influencing environmental behaviour. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",environment;festival;qualitative research;stewardship;cultural tradition;heritage tourism;music;sustainability;tourist attraction;tourist destination,cultural tradition; heritage tourism; modeling; music; sustainability; tourist attraction; tourist destination,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Andersson L.M., Bateman T.S., Individual environmental initiative: Championing natural environmental issues in US business organizations, Academy of Management Journal, 43, 4, pp. 548-570, (2000); Anderton C., Commercializing the carnivalesque: The V festival and image/risk management, Event Management, 12, 1, pp. 39-51, (2009); 4114.0 - Attendance at selected cultural venues and events, Australia, 2009-2010, (2010); Bakan J., The corporation: The pathological pursuit of profit and power, (2004); Banksia Environmental Awards, (2011); Bansal P., Roth K., Why companies go green: A model of ecological responsiveness, Academy of Management Journal, 43, 4, pp. 717-737, (2000); Berry R.J., Stewardship: A default position?, Environmental stewardship: Critical perspectives past and present, pp. 1-13, (2006); Bohdanowicz P., Zientara P., Novotna E., International hotel chains and environmental protection: An analysis of Hilton's we care! programme (Europe, 2006-2008), Journal of Sustainable Tourism, 19, 7, pp. 797-816, (2011); Bowen H.E., Daniels M.J., Does the music matter?

The festival occurs every July in Oaxaca City where it is a premier tourist attraction providing opportunities for socioeconomic growth and development. Yet the festival also creates negative impacts such as commodifi cation and commercialization of the festival, which may lead to the bastardization of culture, including loss of indigenous authenticity and exploitation of local resources. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to critically analyze the positive and negative impacts of the 2007 Guelaguetza in order to determine the extent to which the festival focuses on becoming a tourist attraction at the expense of community celebration. A qualitative research design utilizing the case study approach was employed to analyze positive and negative impacts emerging from the real-world context of the 2007 Guelaguetza. The results of the study revealed that not all that glistens is gold at the festival. Behind the façade of this visually spectacular festival, the Guelaguetza is at real risk of becoming a colorful, attractive, yet meaningless, commercialized tourist venture if tourist and commercial needs are favored at the expense of the people and their traditions. Consequently, now is the time to revisit and redefi ne the purpose of the Guelaguetza to ensure it remains a sociocultural and economically viable annual festival for everyone to enjoy, long into the future.

Its annual Country and Western Music Festival has become the leading event of its type in Australia, attracting over 60,000 visitors every year. The festival, and country music more generally, have become central to the town's identity and tourism marketing strategies. This article discusses the social constructions that have surrounded Tamworth's transition to 'country music capital'-of the 'rural', and of 'country'-within the context of debates about the politics of place marketing. Textual analysis of promotional material and built landscapes reveals representations of rurality (or 'senses of the rural'). In their most commercial form, representations of rurality converge on a dominant notion of 'country', quite different from the 'countryside' and 'rural idyll' in England. This dominant, or normative 'country' forms the basis of imagery for the festival, the Town's marketing strategy, and associated advertising campaigns by major sponsors. It is predominantly masculine, white, working class and nationalist. But links between musical style and discourses of place are complex. Colonial British histories, Celtic musical traditions and North American popular culture all inform 'country' in Tamworth, dissipating nationalist interpretations. Normative constructions also contrast with other, heterogeneous ruralities in Australia, that include the lived experiences of rural Australians, and on stage-in country music-where multiple 'ruralised' identities are performed. Even those who stand to benefit from place promotion have been uncertain about country music and 'the country', because of associated discourses of Tamworth as 'hick' and 'redneck'. In the final section of the paper, reactions of residents to constructions of Tamworth as country music capital are discussed, via the results of a simple resident survey. In contrast to previous studies of the disempowering politics of place marketing, Tamworth residents were on the whole supportive of the new associations and images for the town, despite 'hick' connotations, as it has become a centre for 'country', and for country music. Reasons for this are explored, and resistances discussed. The result is a complex and entangled politics of national identity, gender, race and class, where meanings for place are variously interpreted and negotiated. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

This is a study of festival management implications related to various types of ownership in a sample of music festivals. Three business models are identified: Public, Nonprofit and Private festivals. These three business models are described and compared in terms of governance, structure and content using empirical data from the 14 largest live-music festivals in Sweden. Results show clear and interesting differences between the three business models of festivals related to e.g. decision styles, volunteer involvement and service quality. These results have theoretical as well as practical implications. Differences based on ownership structure of festivals in the tourism industry are also interesting in comparison to other mixed industries such as the health care and the education sector. Most of the differences found are similar to differences found in other mixed industries. Further studies of other sectors in the tourism industry are therefore strongly recommended to establish the fact that tourism is a mixed industry that can learn a great deal from research results from other mixed industries. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.",business model;festival;mixed industry;nonprofit;ownership;sweden;music;tourism management,Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Sweden; business; festival; modeling; music; ownership; tourism management,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Amit R., Zott C., Value creation in e-business, Strategic Management Journal, 22, 6-7, pp. 493-520, (2001); Ballou J.P., Weisbrod B.A., Managerial rewards and the behavior of for profit, governmental, and nonprofit organizations: Evidence from the hospital industry, Journal of Public Economics, 87, 9-10, pp. 1895-1920, (2003); Benz M., Frey B.S., Corporate governance: What can we learn from public governance?, Academy of Management Review, 32, 1, pp. 92-104, (2007); Bingham L.B., Nabatchi T., O'Leary R., The new governance: Practices and processes for stakeholder and citizen participation in the work of government, Public Administration Review, 65, 5, pp. 547-558, (2005); Boissy R.W., Editorial: Business models for scholarly serials, Serials Review, 31, 3, pp. 185-186, (2005); Brooks A.C., Public subsidies and charitable giving: Crowding out, crowding in, or both?, Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, 19, 3, pp. 451-464, (2000); Eikenberry A.M., Kluver J.D., The marketization of the nonprofit sector: Civil society at risk?, Public Administration Review, 64, 2, pp. 132-140, (2004); Eldenburg L., Krishnan R., Public versus private governance: A study of incentives and operational performance, Journal of Accounting and Economics, 35, 3, pp. 377-404, (2003); Francois P., Employee care and the role of nonprofit organizations, Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics/Zeitschrift Fur Die Gesamte Staatswissenschaft, 157, 3, pp. 443-464, (2001); Garrod B., Fyall A., Leask A., Scottish visitor attractions: Managing visitor impacts, Tourism Management, 23, 3, pp. 265-279, (2002); Getz D., Andersson T.D., Larson M., Festival stakeholder roles: Concepts and case studies, Event Management, 10, 2-3, pp. 103-122, (2007); Grangsjo P., Om organisering av turism, (2006); James E., The private nonprofit provision of education - a theoretical model and application to Japan, Journal of Comparative Economics, 10, 3, pp. 255-276, (1986); Kapur K., Weisbrod B.A., The roles of government and nonprofit suppliers in mixed industries, Public Finance Review, 28, 4, pp. 275-308, (2000); Morris M., Schindehutte M., Allen J., The entrepreneur's business model: Toward a unified perspective, Journal of Business Research, 58, 6, pp. 726-735, (2005); Mulhare E.M., Mindful of the future: Strategic planning ideology and the culture of nonprofit management, Human Organization, 58, 3, pp. 323-330, (1999); Oum T.H., Adler N., Yu C.Y., Privatization, corporatization, ownership forms and their effects on the performance of the world's major airports, Journal of Air Transport Management, 12, 3, pp. 109-121, (2006); Qu R.L., Ennew C., Sinclair M.T., The impact of regulation and ownership structure on market orientation in the tourism industry in China, Tourism Management, 26, 6, pp. 939-950, (2005); Ryan W.P., The new landscape for nonprofits, Harvard Business Review, 77, 1, (1999); Schlesinger M., Gray B., A broader vision for managed care, part 1: Measuring the benefit to communities, Health Affaires, 17, 3, pp. 152-168, (1998); Weisbrod B.A., The future of the nonprofit sector: Its entwining with private enterprise and government, Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, 16, 4, pp. 541-555, (1997); Weisbrod B.A., Guest Editor's introduction: The nonprofit mission and its financing, Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, 17, 2, pp. 165-174, (1998); West E.G., Nonprofit organisations - revised theory and new evidence, Public Choice, 63, 2, pp. 165-174, (1989); Voss G.B., Cable D.M., Voss Z.G., Linking organizational values to relationships with external constituents: A study of nonprofit professional theatres, Organization Science, 11, 3, pp. 330-347, (2000); Voss G.B., Voss Z.G., Strategic orientation and firm performance in an artistic environment, Journal of Marketing, 64, 1, pp. 67-83, (2000)","T.

As niche events they face less competition than the dominating field of music festivals, however their success cannot be taken for granted. The purpose of this study was to illuminate success factors of festivals by presenting a case study of the Gladmatfestival in Stavanger, Norway, which has been arranged annually since 1999 and has attracted positive attention and 250,000 visitors, and been financially successful. Data were collected by interviews, observation and document studies. It is concluded that the festival's success depends mainly upon its embedment in a strong network of food and meal-producing institutions and organizations, restaurants and outstanding chefs. The network depends upon a tradition of food production in the area, and from the outset local food produce has been at the heart of the Gladmatfestival. The scope of the festival has developed from regional to national and Nordic coverage, and it reaches out with activities and network development to the Nordic region and also internationally. While networking has been essential, careful research and entrepreneurial leadership placed within a simple and cheap organizational structure have been the second and third reasons for the success. Taken together, the leadership, networking and food-oriented context have made sponsoring and donations available and up to 100 exhibitors have been willing to pay each year for their stands at the festival. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.",entrepreneurial networks;entrepreneurship;festival management;festival success factors;food festival;gladmatfestival;stavanger;norway;entrepreneur;festival;tourist attraction;tourist destination,Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Norway; Rogaland; Scandinavia; Stavanger; entrepreneur; festival; food industry; food production; leadership; tourist attraction; tourist destination,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Andersson T., Getz D., Festival Ownership.

The potential losses are equated to the total amount of associated expenditures of visitors spending in the area. An ex post assessment is carried out to measure the impacts of visitors expenditure in a tourism activity, the 3-day Rain Forest World Music Festival 2009 (RFWMF2009) in Santubong, Sarawak. On site data on all associated expenditures spent in the area during the festival were collected from a sample of the visitors. The results show that 34%, 18% and 48% of the visitors have participated in 1, 2 and 3 days in the festival, respectively. The average total expenditure of per participant is about RM334 per day.

The first objective of this paper is to investigate the underlying dimensions of motivation for attending an international festival in Turkey and whether motivation will vary across six different festival products (symphony, rock, world music, dance, ballet, and theater). The second purpose is to understand how festival attendees perceive the socio-economic impacts of the festival and how these perceived impacts vary across different festival attendee groups. Finally, the study examines the overall satisfaction of festival attendees with respect to different festival products. The empirical data was collected by way of self-administered questionnaires to obtain perceptions and motivations of 523 attendees in Eskisehir International Festival. The results showed that there were significant differences in motivation among attendees from six different festival products. Duncan's multiple-range tests were performed to further examine differences in motivation among these attendees. The mean scores of different groups indicate that “rock event” attendees tended to have lower motivation scores than other groups and have the lowest ratings on the factor of “family togetherness”. However, attendees did not differ on the perceived importance of socio-economic impacts and satisfaction with the festival, irrespective of the festival product attended. Festivals and special events have increased worldwide because they provide significant economic, socio-cultural, and political impacts on destinations. While a plethora of studies have examined tourists' motivation and socio-economic impacts, little research has been conducted on the motivation and socio-economic impact of festival attendees with regard to different product offerings. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",factor analysis;motivation (psychology);multivariate analysis of variance;perceived socio-economic impacts,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Arcodia C., Whitford M., Festival attendance and the development of social capital, Journal of Convention and Event Tourism, 892, pp. 1-18, (2006);

This article discusses the event's contribution to Edinburgh's reimaging and local involvement. After outlining links between cultural events and contemporary urban policy, an in-depth case study charts the evolution of the MTV Europe Awards Edinburgh 03 and how it became embroiled in local political realities. The event became politicized because MTV was given £750 thousand public subsidy to part-fund the show's temporary structure and the outside broadcast costs of a simultaneous live concert in Edinburgh's city center Princes Street Gardens. Officials argued that, beyond the local economic benefit - estimated initially at £4 million - this was justified as the event offered extensive local inclusion and unique promotional opportunities that would give the city's conservative image a contemporary edge. They believed Edinburgh's reimaging as an exciting short-break destination would occur because of the association with A-list celebrities and MTV's innovative marketing that connected with the global traveling, yet elusive, ""MTV generation."" MTV found Edinburgh an ideal city as its experienced events team eased production of their complex ""live"" television show, while its young people and iconic place features gave the show a distinctive narrative. The article's key finding is that MTV's desire for these place features to reimage their television show meant the event primarily benefited them and the local tourist industry. MTV happily fostered local involvement - creating memorable moments for participants - but their celebrity and place focus meant their voices were often marginalized. This was accentuated because the local newspaper, part of a group often critical of public sector organizers, emphasized: the event's cost and disruption, the inappropriate actions of public officials, and MTV's ticket allocation to corporate clients.

Data were collected by questionnaires to the registered festival managers. It was concluded that Finnmark is a festive county where 72,000 people share close to 60 festivals arranged annually in 19 municipalities across the county. The festivals were categorized as either music, arts, sports or market festivals, however the largest group were named thematic festivals as they are each built around rather unique themes, thus representing a diverse example of festival variety and creativity. Even so, live music and food sales are found at most festivals, and all festivals have more than one main activity. Festivals are by no means a source of paid employment for the inhabitants, but rich opportunities for more than 3000 volunteers to participate in creating compressed cultural expressions and develop social networks. The number of visitors at the festivals varies from 100 to 10,000 persons. It is also a cost effective way of culture production as most of the festivals present budgets below 500,000 NOK. Entrance fees, sales of merchandise, sponsorship and public municipality funding are the most important source of sponsorship. A wide range of themes are represented in these festivals in which ethnicity, nationality and various border themes also play roles as ideological bases and cultural framing of the events. The tourism potential of the festivals and their actual production processes seems underdeveloped. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.",festival;festival categories;festival ecology;festival management;festival ownership;festival tourism-orientation;finnmark;norway;ecotourism;ethnicity;ownership;tourism management;tourist attraction,Eurasia; Europe; Finnmark; Northern Europe; Norway; Scandinavia; ecotourism; ethnicity; festival; ownership; social network; tourism management; tourist attraction,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Allen J., O'Toole W., McDonnell I., Harris R., Festival and Special Event Management, (2002); Andersson T.D., Carlsen J., Ali-Knight J., Jaeger K., Mykletun R.J., Taylor R., A Description of Answers to a Survey of Festivals in Western Australia, Scotland, Sweden and Norway, (2008); Andersson T.D., Getz D., Stakeholder management strategies of festivals, Journal of Convention and Event Tourism, 9, 3, pp. 199-220, (2008); Aronsen M., Qvart 06 - Mer enn musikk.

Festivals are considered to be important generators of economic benefits. The aims of this paper are to segment the market of two music festivals that took place in two regions of Portugal (Oporto and the Coast of Alentejo) according to the participants' expenditure patterns and, also, to analyse the differences among the segments identified in terms of socio-demographic profile and travel behaviour. In order to accomplish these objectives, a visitor survey was undertaken in the summer of 2008 yielding a total of 228 questionnaires. A hierarchical cluster analysis has been carried out. Three clusters emerged - 'residents with low expenditures', 'visitors with medium expenditures' and 'more attractive visitors'. The 'more attractive visitors' have almost the double of the expenditure of the other groups. This research enables us to obtain information in order to define more appropriate strategies to increase the positive economic impacts of events.

For its first six years, the festival had no relationship with Chinese heritage but in 2004, the seventh festival was rebranded as the 'Go for Gold Chinese Festival' and the event experienced something of a revival. Its transformation into a festival celebrating Chinese history and heritage has helped it develop into a major regional event, second only to Tamworth's Country Music Festival.

This article focuses on music events contributing to the development of pop/rock tourism. In the past few years, Montenegro has staged performances by some of today's biggest music stars and thus tries to boost Montenegro's image as an attractive and, above all, exclusive tourist destination in the Mediterranean.

This phenomenal growth, coupled with increased consumer awareness and choice, requires sustained development and growth in the future. Music festivals are unique events that attract audiences for a variety of reasons; however, while music-based events are an extremely popular form of entertainment, research exploring the motivations of music festival audiences is sparse, especially from a UK perspective. Crompton and McKay contend that event managers should strive to better understand the motives of festival attendance in order to design better products and services for them and because motives are a precursor of satisfaction and a factor in decision making, this in turn can lead to greater attendance. This study critically compares the visitor motivations for attending two UK-based music festivals to challenge and ultimately support existing ideas developed from similar research overseas. The article establishes some of the first research into this area within the UK and challenges common assumptions from those in industry. A range of secondary research was considered and a review of existing literature on the subject was undertaken. Although the sample size was relatively small, the results showed that socializing with friends and family was a primary motive. Most importantly, the article supported the notion that multiple motivations come into play and it suggests that it is risky for festival managers to rely solely on the theme of the event itself. It is equally important to create a fun and festive atmosphere that offers ample opportunity to socialize and have new and nonmusical experiences. Several recommendations were made for existing and future managers including focusing on realigning marketing and service strategies. Recommendations were also made for future research in terms of adopting new methodological approaches including the use of multiple means of analysis. The article finally challenges the nature of the underpinning theory and questions the reason that so much of what is understood is still based in the field of sociology in tourism, with very little underpinning theory dedicated to the events industry, despite its emergence as an academic field over a decade ago. © 2009 Cognizant Comm.

Festivals and other recurring events are often viewed as tourist attractions, and are commonly used in place marketing and destination image-making strategies. Little attention has been paid, however, to their individual or collective viability and long-term sustainability. Supportive data are provided from a survey of 14 live-music festivals in Sweden in which responding festival managers confirmed the importance of attaining ""institutional status,"" occupying a unique ""niche"" in the community, sustaining committed stakeholders, and practicing constant innovation. Theoretical conclusions are drawn on the institutionalization process for festivals, including a set of propositions that can be used both as indicators of institutional status, and as hypotheses for future research. © 2008 Cognizant Comm.

However, tourism is a vulnerable basis for the local economy of towns and cities as it depends on far-reaching, mobile and unstable networks of visitors, cultural industries and attractions, local authorities, voluntary associations, buildings, objects and so forth directing flows of people, money, information and images. These networks produce new cultural economies and policies, contingently committed to the projects of producing 'tourist places'. This article challenges conventional understandings of territorial learning by comparing two cases of cultural tourism and their spin-off developments in Roskilde, Denmark: first the Viking Ship Museum, its development into a 'Museum Island' in the harbour area during the 1990s and its project 'Return of the Viking Longship'; second, the Roskilde Festival with its still not fully developed projects 'Musicon Valley' and 'Rock City'. We emphasize the role of local authorities and of international connections. In so doing we attempt to bridge the gap between contemporary discussions of tourism and cultural economy in cultural and economic geography, and ask how these attractions, events and projects have emerged and how the dynamics producing tourist places are organized in time and space. © 2006 SAGE Publications.",cultural economy;cultural tourism;networks;place;rock music;vikings;cultural geography;economic geography;heritage tourism;music,Denmark; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Roskilde; Scandinavia; cultural geography; economic geography; heritage tourism; local economy; music,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Allen J., Living on Thin Abstractions: More Power/Economic Knowledge, Environment and Planning A, 34, 3, pp. 451-466, (2002); Amin A., Thrift N., Cities: Reimagining the Urban, (2002); Ateljevio I., Doorne S., Culture, Economy and Tourism Commodities: Social Relations of Production and Consumption, Tourist Studies, 3, 2, pp. 123-141, (2003); Baerenholdt J.O., Aarsaether N., Coping Strategies, Social Capital and Space, European Urban and Regional Studies, 9, 2, pp. 151-165, (2002); Baerenholdt J.O., Haldrup M., Economy-Culture Relations and the Geographies of Regional Development, Voices from the North, New Trends in Nordic Human Geography, pp. 49-66, (2003); Baerenholdt J.O., Haldrup M., On the Track of the Vikings, Tourism and Mobilities: Places to Play, Places in Play, pp. 78-89, (2004); Baerenholdt J.O., Haldrup M., Larsen J., Urry J., Performing Tourist Places, (2004); Bayliss D., Denmark's Creative Potential: The Role of Culture within Danish Urban Development Strategies, International Journal of Cultural Policy, 10, 1, pp. 5-28, (2004); Bourdieu P., The Logic of Practice, (1990); Coe N.M., Bunnel T.G., ""Spatializing"" Knowledge Communities: Towards a Conceptualization of Transnational Innovation Networks, Global Networks, 3, 4, pp. 437-456, (2003); Coe N.M., Johns J., Beyond Production Clusters, Towards a Critical Political Economy of Networks in the Film and Television Industries, Cultural Industries and the Production of Culture, pp. 188-204, (2004); Crang P., Performing the Tourist Product, Touring Cultures: Transformations of Travel and Theory, pp. 137-154, (1997); Crouch D., Surrounded by Place, Embodied Encounters, Tourism: Between Place and Performance, pp. 207-218, (2002); Crouch D., Aronsson L., Wahlgreen L., Tourist Encounters, Tourist Studies, 1, 3, pp. 253-270, (2001); Debbage K.G., Daniels P., The Tourist Industry and Economic Geography, Missed Opportunities, The Economic Geography of Tourism: A Supply-side Analysis, pp. 17-39, (1998); Dicken P., Kelly P.F., Olds K., Yeung H.W-C., Chains and Networks, Territory and Scale: Towards a Relational Framework for Analysing the Global Economy, Global Networks, 1, 2, pp. 89-112, (2001); Edensor T., Performing Tourism, Staging Tourism - (Re)producing Tourist Space and Practice, Tourist Studies, 1, 1, pp. 59-81, (2001); Ettlinger N., Towards a Critical Theory of Untidy Geographies: The Spatiality of Emotions in Consumption and Production, Feminist Economics, 10, 3, pp. 21-54, (2004); Florida R., The Rise of the Creative Class: And How It's Transforming Work, Leisure and Everyday Life, (2002); Florida R., The Economic Geography of Talent, Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 92, 4, pp. 743-755, (2002); Florida R., Tinagli I., Europe in the Creative Age, (2004); Flyvbjerg B., Making Social Science Matter.
